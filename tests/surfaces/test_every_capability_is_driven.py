"""Every registered capability, called on every surface, with the answer inspected.

The three gates that should have caught most of this phase's findings **compare names and
never calls**. ``tests/conformance/test_surfaces.py`` is set equality over strings;
``tests/conformance/test_phase2_surface_parity.py`` admits in its own docstring that a
registered capability is "trusted to be projected rather than measured"; and 36 of the 57
wire names are never named in any test file that drives a surface at all. Under that, a
capability could be listed by every gate and answer ``'()' is not a valid Kind`` on one
surface, an empty ``inputSchema`` on another and 12 000 rows over a published ceiling of
10 000 on the third — which is what they were doing.

So this drives them. For each capability and each asset class it implements it builds a
request from the declared parameter schema, sends it through REST, MCP and the CLI, and
asserts the *answer is well formed* — not that it is correct, which no generic gate can
know, but that the shape a caller receives is one the projection is allowed to produce.

What "well formed" means here, and why each clause is in it:

* **REST** answers a status this projection classifies — 200, or one of the four failures
  ``dispatch`` names — with a JSON body. A 500 means an exception escaped classification,
  which is the finding that turned a missing environment variable into a retry storm.
* **MCP** answers a result and never a JSON-RPC error, carries the request ``id``, and its
  text parses as JSON. A protocol error tells an agent the *call* broke; a dropped id means
  the caller's future never resolves.
* **The CLI** exits 0 or 1 and never with a traceback. Exit 0 over an empty answer is the
  quietest failure this codebase has a history with, so a successful run must also have
  written something to stdout.
* **The three agree** about whether the request was answerable. One surface returning rows
  while another refuses the identical request is the divergence the projection exists to
  end, and it is what nothing was measuring.

**No network.** Sockets are replaced with one that raises :class:`_NetworkBlocked` before
any address is resolved, so a capability that reaches a venue fails deterministically and
in a way this file can recognise. Reaching for the network is not a failure of the
projection — it is out of this gate's scope and is recorded as such rather than being
silently counted as a pass. What *is* in scope is that the reach-out is reported the same
way on all three surfaces.

**Writes are not driven on the CLI**, and the exclusion is measured rather than listed: a
capability the network surfaces *refuse* (403) is one that writes to the lake, and the local
CLI would actually run it. Which ones those are is read off the REST answer in the same
test, so the list cannot go stale.
