"""The commands a user actually types, checked against the modules they name.

``crocodile`` is the one console script this refactor produces and nothing in the repository
exercised it. ``test_phase1_exit`` runs ``crypcodile`` and ``stockodile``, whose targets did
not change, so the entry that *did* change was the only one no gate touched — and in this
checkout it raises ``ModuleNotFoundError: crocodile.crypto.legacy.cli``, a tree the merge
deleted.

That particular breakage is stale environment state: the shim in ``.venv/bin`` was generated
before the cutover and only a reinstall rewrites it. The missing gate is not. A console
script is a two-part promise — a name in ``pyproject.toml`` and a module that answers to it —
and nothing was checking the second half for the primary command.

Everything below therefore reads the declaration and drives the module it names, which is
what a correct install would run. The one thing it deliberately does not do is invoke
``.venv/bin/crocodile``: that would be testing this working copy's installation rather than
this working copy's source, and it is shared with other agents.
