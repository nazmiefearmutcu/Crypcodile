"""A canonical symbol says which market it is in, however the parameter is spelled.

``resolve_asset_class`` reads the source out of ``source:RAW`` and asks the two source
registries which market claims it — evidence rather than a guess, and the reason a caller
does not have to name the asset class twice. The surfaces then handed it exactly one field,
the one literally named ``symbol``, and six two-implementation capabilities spell it
``symbols``: ``catalog-scan``, ``resolve-symbols``, ``replay``, ``export``, ``backfill`` and
``collect``.

So ``?symbol=deribit:BTC-PERPETUAL`` answered 200 and ``?symbols=deribit:BTC-PERPETUAL``
answered 400 *cannot tell which market*, for the same symbol, on the same lake. Loud, but it
made six capabilities unreachable without an out-of-band parameter the symbol already
determines.

It then happened again, silently, and the second time is why the last section of this file
exists. ``basis`` and ``spot-future-basis`` spell their legs ``spot_symbol``,
``perp_symbol`` and ``future_symbol``. While they were crypto-only they resolved by "there
is only one implementation"; the moment they grew equity halves — in a branch that touches
neither the dispatcher nor this file — that step stopped applying and both went unreachable
on CLI, REST and MCP at once. The list below was the *evidence* for the first fix and could
not notice the second: it names six capabilities by hand and nothing re-derives it.

So the population is derived from the registry instead, and the answer a capability gives is
checked rather than assumed.
