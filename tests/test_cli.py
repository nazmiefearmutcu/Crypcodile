"""The two CLI commands that are hand-written rather than projected.

Almost everything this file used to hold has gone. It was an acceptance suite for the crypto
Typer app — one test per ``catalog``/``catalog-stats``/``catalog-dates``/``search``/
``resolve-symbols``/``data-coverage``/``export``/``replay``/``indicators``/``query``
command — and every one of those names is now a capability that
:mod:`crocodile.surfaces.cli` projects with no per-command code. ``tests/conformance/
test_surfaces.py`` asserts each of them is reachable on all three surfaces exactly once and
``tests/surfaces/test_end_to_end.py`` drives one of them end to end against a real lake, so
a command-by-command copy here would be pinning a loop forty-seven times.

The interactive wizards went with them: ``select_symbols_interactively``,
``prompt_time_range_helper`` and ``resolve_input_symbols`` were helpers of that Typer module
and have no successor — a required option replaces a prompt.

What is left is the two commands in :mod:`crocodile.surfaces.operate` that these tests were
the only cover for. They are hand-written because they are not capabilities: ``migrate-lake``
renames directories without opening a Parquet file and ``shell`` is a REPL over the command
table, so neither has an asset class, a parameter schema or an honest provenance.
