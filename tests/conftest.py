# There is deliberately no `sys.modules["xgboost"] = MagicMock()` here.
#
# One lived at this line, to "safeguard against xgboost C-library loading failures on
# macOS" — the wheel needs libomp and `import xgboost` raises XGBoostError without it.
# The safeguard was unnecessary and it was not free. `crocodile.crypto.analytics.
# funding_prediction` is the only module in the tree that imports xgboost, and it already
# wraps the import in `except BaseException`, which is what XGBoostError needs; the module
# handles an absent library on its own, exactly as it does in production.
#
# What the stub did instead was make the import *succeed*, so XGBOOST_AVAILABLE was True in
# every test process regardless of the machine. `predict_next_funding` then took its
# xgboost branch, `MagicMock().predict(...)[0]` floated to MagicMock's default `__float__`,
# and the capability returned `predicted_funding_rate=1.0` — a mock artefact with the shape
# of a forecast. `funding-predict`'s only numeric check sat behind
# `if result["method"] == "rolling_mean"`, a branch that could then never be taken.
#
# A mock that decides which branch of the code under test runs is not a safeguard against
# the environment; it is a second environment nobody chose. Tests that want the xgboost
# path patch XGBOOST_AVAILABLE and inject a regressor that computes — see
# tests/analytics/test_funding_prediction.py, whose `_WeightedSumRegressor` returns a value
# derivable by hand, so the assertion is about the wiring and not about MagicMock.

# NOTE: PyQt6 / pyqtgraph are intentionally NOT mocked here. The FlowMap GUI
# tests exercise real (offscreen) Qt widgets — QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen above
# keeps that headless and hang-free, which is why a blanket sys.modules stub of
# PyQt6 would break them (e.g. QMainWindow.move missing on a dummy widget).
