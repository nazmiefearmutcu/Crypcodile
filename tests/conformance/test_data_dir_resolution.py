"""One module decides where the lake is, and it is ``core.config``.

``crypto/legacy/api_server.py`` carried two data-directory resolvers. ``_get_lake_client``
read ``CRYPCODILE_DATA_DIR`` defaulting to ``data``; ``_get_api_catalog`` read a bare
``DATA_DIR`` and otherwise probed ``test_data``, then ``data``, then
``~/Crypcodile/test_data``, taking the first that held a registered channel.
``POST /api/v1/simulate-price-impact`` used the second and every other lake route used the
first — so two routes over the *same capability* could answer from two different lakes,
and with no environment set at all they read ``./data`` and ``./test_data``. Nothing
raised. Both are perfectly good lakes; they are just not the same one.

``Settings`` existed the whole time and was imported by nothing but ``crocodile/__init__``.
The test below is the part that keeps it wired: a route-level assertion catches the two
resolvers disagreeing, but only a scan catches a *third* one being added next to them,
which is how the second one arrived.
