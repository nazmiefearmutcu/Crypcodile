"""Counts and enumerations that are stated in prose, asserted against what the code holds.

Every claim in this file was wrong at some point, and each one was wrong for the same
reason: a sentence stated a number, the number moved, and nothing read the sentence again.
The merge falsified six of them at once — three docstrings saying the registry holds 48
capabilities when it holds 49, a connector factory enumerating nine of its ten exchanges, a
provider factory enumerating two of its five, an exemption list described as six names when
it is seven, and a ledger docstring that said "not empty, 21 entries" after Phase 3 emptied
it.

The repair for a wrong number is to write the right one. The repair for a number that goes
wrong unwatched is this file. A docstring that enumerates a registry is a gate somebody
declined to write, because the enumeration is derivable and the comparison is three lines;
what the prose adds is the *argument*, and the argument stays honest only while the list
beside it does.

Two rules kept here deliberately:

* **Assert against the live object, never against a literal.** A test that pins ``49`` in
  two files has moved the duplication rather than removed it. Every expectation below is
  computed from ``REGISTRY``, ``IRREDUCIBLE`` or a factory's ``_REGISTRY``.
* **A missing sentence fails too.** Each test locates its anchor phrase and fails if the
  anchor is gone, so rewording the paragraph out from under the gate is a red test rather
  than a silently vacuous one — the failure mode
  ``tests/conformance/test_gates.py`` documents for gates whose subject can empty.
