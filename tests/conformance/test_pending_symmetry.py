"""The rules that keep the two symmetry ledgers honest, and stop either becoming a hiding place.

Phase 2 registered 49 capabilities — 47 ported by the four batch modules plus the two the
parity gate found at its exit — whose crypto halves worked and whose equity halves arrived
in Phase 3. Without somewhere honest to record that, the port had only dishonest options:
leave them out of the registry (and the surfaces stop being projections of it), or park
them on ``IRREDUCIBLE`` (and claim the market cannot have an equity analogue, which is
false and permanent).

``PENDING_SYMMETRY`` is the honest option, and it is only honest while these hold.

``IRREDUCIBLE``'s rules live here too, beside its twin's, which is the change an exit review
forced. ``PENDING_SYMMETRY`` had a hoarding gate and ``IRREDUCIBLE`` had none — and the
hazard the hoarding gate exists for is *stronger* on the permanent list, not weaker. The
review gave ``peg-deviation`` an equity implementation at runtime and ran every gate that
mentions ``IRREDUCIBLE``: all of them passed, over a capability that had just stopped being
irreducible. A stale entry there means a regression to asymmetry is invisible forever,
because the name was already excused forever.

That review then declared the hole closed, and a later referee showed it was not. Deleting
the equity half of ``iv-surface`` and writing the name onto ``IRREDUCIBLE`` in the same
breath passed all 778 conformance tests, and so did the same pair of edits over ``ofi``,
``census``, ``whale-alerts``, ``open-interest`` and ``liquidity-depth``. The gate the review
added fires on ``set(cap.impls) == {CRYPTO, EQUITY}`` *and* a name on ``IRREDUCIBLE``, which
is the state the reviewer produced by hand — adding an implementation to an already-excused
name. Deleting first and excusing second never enters it. The gate was written for the
experiment, not for the defect.

So the load moved off "which excuse was reached for" and onto two facts nothing can restate:

- **Every exemption ledger is censused.** ``PENDING_SYMMETRY`` had one and it worked — it is
  why the delete-then-*schedule* route was caught while delete-then-excuse was not — so all
  of them have one now, including the two this file adds, and a meta-gate fails if a ledger
  appears in the registry module without a census here. A gate shipped together with the
  exemption it suggests is the shape this codebase keeps re-finding.
- **The asymmetry frontier itself is pinned.** Which capabilities serve which asset classes
  is the property the ledgers exist to qualify, so it is asserted directly. That census does
  not care which ledger a deletion is laundered through, or whether it is laundered at all,
  or whether the ledger it uses had been invented yet.

A third ledger arrives with them, and for a defect of the same family: ``SHARED_IMPLEMENTATION``
records the capabilities where one function legitimately answers for both asset classes, so
that everywhere else two dict keys may not point at one callable. See its rules below.

``label-transfers`` off M4, which left together because the method that closes them is one
piece of work; the five spread capabilities off M5; ``liquidity-depth`` and ``chaos-score``

last ``markets``, ``universe``, ``census`` and ``collect-market`` off M3, all four of which

directions is the property worth watching", and until an exit review looked, nothing was
watching. Two things made that hard to see. The declaration in ``core/capability.py`` reads
``PENDING_SYMMETRY = {}``, so the module a reviewer opens shows an empty dict while three
batch modules assembled 21 live entries into it at import time. And
:func:`test_phase_3_exit_the_ledger_must_be_empty` skipped whenever the ledger was
non-empty, so it was green at 21 and would have been green at 48. That skip was then
conditioned on this pin — which fixed the growth case and left one hole open at the far
end, because an empty ledger equals an empty pin and the test would have skipped at the
finish line too. See that function.

No count is written into this docstring, on purpose. Several agents emptied this dict in
parallel and a sentence naming a number is a merge conflict that resolves to a lie — this
paragraph said "It is 16", then "It is 10", then "It is 7" across three merges, each true

This is the census ``IRREDUCIBLE`` did not have, and its absence is the whole of the

exactly why a referee deleting an equity half and *scheduling* the name was caught in two
tests while the same deletion *excused* on this list passed all 778. Three greps found the
asymmetry: ``IRREDUCIBLE`` was mentioned in tests only by three hand-written negative pins in
``tests/capabilities/test_ops.py``, none of which is a count.

The justifications are pinned as text and not merely as keys. A permanent exemption is
carried by its argument — which is what
:func:`~tests.conformance.test_capability.test_every_irreducible_justification_names_a_market_property`
grades and what a reviewer reads — so an entry whose argument is rewritten is a different
entry, and the diff is the only place anyone will ever see it. The same reasoning
``_LEDGER_AS_SHIPPED`` gives for pinning the *method* beside the name.

merge conflict that resolves to a lie. The number that matters is the length of the literal.
