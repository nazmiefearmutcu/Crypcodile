"""What the lake can be written with, it can be read back with.

The sink could write all 30 canonical channels. ``from_row`` had 13 hand-written
arms and raised ``ValueError: Unknown channel tag`` on the other 17 — three of
them (``limit_order_fill``, ``balance_correction``, ``por_update``) live channels
``base_onchain`` emits, whose payloads the sink had just stopped discarding. So a
``base_onchain`` lake recorded data ``CrypcodileClient.replay`` could not read.
Nothing compared the two sets, because each side only ever tested itself.

Both sides now derive their channel list from the ``Record`` union, which is why
the round trip below is the assertion that carries the weight: it writes real
Parquet through the real sink and reads it back through the real reader, so it
fails on a missing coercion, a wrong dtype, a column the schema forgot or a field
that comes back as something else — not only on a channel nobody wired up.
