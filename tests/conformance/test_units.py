"""What a column's name promises about its unit, and the one suffix that promises twice.

``_pct`` means *percent* in one module of ``core.analytics`` and *fraction* in the others.
``core/analytics/slippage.py`` multiplies by 100; ``core/analytics/carry.py``'s
``basis_pct``, ``annualized_pct`` and ``carry_pct`` are fractions, as are
``crypto/analytics/peg_deviation.py``'s ``deviation_pct`` and the bands
``core/analytics/liquidity_depth.py`` measures against. That is a factor of 100 in one
direction for a consumer that treats them alike, and no surface annotates either.

``slippage.py`` is base code no branch in this phase touched, so the divergence was
inherited rather than created — but this phase added four new *fraction*-valued ``_pct``
columns into the same package under the same suffix, which is what turned a quirk into a
pattern. Nobody is renaming a shipped wire column to fix it: ``slippage_pct`` is in the
pinned pre-merge surface inventory, and changing either its name or its unit is a silent
break for every consumer that already divides or does not.

So the units are *declared*, once, where a gate can check that every one of them is
declared. The value of the table is not that it converts anything — it converts nothing —
but that the next author to write a ``_pct`` column has to write a line here saying which
of the three conventions they picked, instead of picking one by copying whichever
neighbour they happened to read.
