The **field and the value** are declared beside the argument and asserted against the
tree, on the same discipline :data:`CONSTANT_BY_DEFINITION` carries — an exemption is a
licence for one number in one field, not for a file. ``_UNPUBLISHED_SIZE = 0.0`` and
``_ASSUMED_SIZE = 1.0`` are the same syntax and opposite claims: the first says a scrape
contributes no volume, the second reported the poll count as share volume. A file-keyed
licence carries over from one to the other in silence.

Keying on the value alone had the same hole one axis over, and the docstring above said
so while the code did not: this module is licensed for ``0.0`` because a quote bar's
``volume`` is a structural zero, and that licence silently covered ``Trade(amount=0.0)``
and ``DepthProfile(reference_price=0.0, …)`` added anywhere in the same file — which is
exactly where new resamplers get added. A zero volume on a quote bar and a zero
reference price on a depth profile are different claims about different quantities, and
only one of them has an argument.


Every entry is a record asserting a quantity nobody measured. Adding one is allowed
— a structural zero can be the honest encoding, as ``ohlcv_from_quotes`` argues for
a quote bar's ``volume`` — but it is allowed *out loud*, with the argument next to
it, on the same discipline as :data:`crocodile.core.capability.IRREDUCIBLE`. A
silent one is what shipped a zero-width NBBO at ``prov_confidence=1.0``.

Both entries below were invisible to the scanner that shipped with this list, and
that is why it was empty rather than because the tree was clean. It compared
``kw.value`` against ``ast.Constant``, so ``_UNPUBLISHED_SIZE = 0.0`` beside
``amount=_UNPUBLISHED_SIZE`` — which is what the fix for the ``google_finance``
fabrication actually wrote — produced no hit at all. Restoring ``_ASSUMED_SIZE =
1.0`` would have kept the gate green. A gate that only sees the literal spelling
is a gate that teaches people to rename.

test read, sitting between `_EVASIONS` and `_HONEST_READINGS`, which are both parametrised.
An unread list of limitations decays exactly the way an unread list of exemptions does: the
earlier review found the plain `from msgspec.structs import replace` spelling evading a
guard whose own evasion set covered only the aliased form, which is the same failure as an
undocumented blind spot with extra steps. The gate looked complete.

So each entry now carries a snippet the scanner must **not** flag, and
:func:`test_gate3b_a_documented_blind_spot_is_still_open` runs it. Close a blind spot and
that test goes red, which is the prompt to delete the entry; delete an entry without
closing it and :func:`test_gate3b_the_blind_spot_list_is_the_set_that_was_measured` goes
red instead. The prose can no longer drift away from the scanner in either direction.

"""Every spelling of one fabrication the scanner has to read as the same thing.

The list is the review's, verbatim, plus the chained forms it implies. The scanner
that shipped caught the first row and missed every other one — which is exactly how
``_UNPUBLISHED_SIZE = 0.0`` came to satisfy a gate whose whole subject it is, and why
restoring ``_ASSUMED_SIZE = 1.0`` would also have satisfied it.

The plain ``from msgspec.structs import replace`` row is the later one. ``_replace_calls``
seeded its alias set with ``{"replace"}`` and then excluded that exact name, so the
plainest spelling in the family evaded — and this list covered only the ``as swap``
form, the single spelling that *was* caught, so the parametrised test reported green
over a hole in the middle of what it claimed to cover. A probe set that only holds the
cases the implementation already handles is not a probe set.

The four guard rows are the latest, and one of them used to sit in
:data:`_HONEST_READINGS` as "a conditional with one measured branch" — declared
acceptable on the argument that a real adapter writes a fallback. ``msn_money`` is what
that argument looked like in production: ``safe_float(open_p[idx]) if idx <
len(open_p) else 0.0`` on all five of a bar's measurements, so the tail of every ragged
chart payload became zero-priced bars at ``prov=NATIVE``. A required measurement is not
a field with a sensible default. Where the guard takes the constant branch the payload
supplied nothing, and the honest move is to skip the record.

What is still not seen is in :data:`FABRICATION_BLIND_SPOTS`, out loud.

    A *witness*, not a single fixed baseline, and that is the whole of the change this
    function represents. The gate's name claims a formula varies with every input it
    declares, and the honest way to test one input is to hold the others somewhere and move
    it — but "somewhere" cannot be an arbitrary constant, because a clamped term is flat over
    part of its range and a fixed baseline lands inside one.

    Both live examples are the multiplicative kind, and neither is a defect. Hold every key
    of ``book_snapshot_slice`` at 1 and ``age_ns == window_ns``, so ``freshness`` is exactly
    zero and the product is zero whatever ``n_levels`` does — the fill term is real, and the
    baseline switched it off. Worse, *no* uniform baseline can switch it back on, because
    ``age`` and ``window`` are equal in all of them. ``ohlcv_from_ohlcv``'s ``covered_ns`` is
    the same story with ``sampled_ns``. So the search is over assignments rather than over
    one of them: ``{n_requested: 1, age_ns: 0, window_ns: 1}`` witnesses ``n_levels``,
    ``{sampled_ns: 1, tradeable_ns: 2}`` witnesses ``covered_ns``, and every declared input
    of every registered formula has a witness today.

    Saturation is therefore handled by asking the right question rather than by an exemption
    list. "This input never moves the answer" is the defect; "this input does not move the
    answer *here*" is what a clamp is for, and a gate that could not tell them apart would
    have to be loosened until it stopped saying anything — which is the state it was found in.

    least one* input". A formula with one live input and three decorative ones passed with

    still listed all four keys as though they had been checked.

    That is not hypothetical. A referee found ``treasury_carry``'s ``n_price_legs`` frozen at
    its ``def`` default because no call site passes it, so one of that formula's three terms
    is dead in production while the old gate reported the formula as varying — on the
    strength of the other two.

    Note what this gate can and cannot see, because the ``treasury_carry`` finding sits
    across the line. It probes the *formula*, so it can say every declared input is
    load-bearing in the arithmetic. It cannot say a call site actually passes one: an input
    that varies here and is never supplied is a reachability fact about the caller, and
    reaching for it would mean this gate scanning call sites, which is Gate 3's job and a
