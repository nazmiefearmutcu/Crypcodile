# Ruff findings in the two legacy surfaces on the day Phase 1 closed. They are
# inherited — both forks carried them under their old names, where nothing was
# ever pointed at them. The number exists so the debt can only shrink: lower it
# when you fix something, and never raise it. `core` and `contrib` are held to
# zero separately below, and that is the line new code is written on.
#
# 476 → 444: Track A rewrote the import block of 44 crypto modules, and ruff's
# isort rule was already unhappy with 32 of them.
# 444 → 431: the same for 23 equity modules on the other half of Track A.
# 431 → 430: the tree had been sitting a finding below its own cap. A budget with
# slack in it is a budget that lets the next finding in for free, which is the
# whole thing a ratchet is for.
# 430 → 429: the two forked `analytics/slippage.py` modules merged into one under
# `core`, which is held to zero, so their inherited findings left the legacy tree
# with them.
# 429 → 428: the two data-dir resolvers in the crypto REST server became one, and
# its import block was reformatted on the way past.
# 428 → 240: Phase 2 deleted the six hand-written surface stacks — 15 899 lines,
# and 188 of the findings were theirs. What is left is 238 in `crypto` and 2 in
# `equity`, which is the shape the merge always had: the crypto fork is the older
# and larger tree. Note the ratchet did *not* fall by the whole of what left,
# because `crypto/legacy/mcp_server.py` did not entirely go — the two Base pool
# readers moved to `crypto/exchanges/base_onchain/price.py`, and their findings
