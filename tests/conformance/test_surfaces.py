"""Gate 4 — every capability appears in all three surfaces, exactly once each.

This is the assertion the whole surface phase is measured by. Six hand-written stacks
drifted apart because nothing ever compared them; the projection is only worth anything if
something does.

Two things this file is careful about, both learned from earlier gates in this merge:

* It must not be **vacuously green**. The registry holds two capabilities, so a gate that
  only ever sees conforming input has not been shown to reject anything. Every comparison
  below is therefore also driven with a fixture — a capability registered mid-test, a
  surface made to forget a name — so the failing branch is exercised rather than assumed.
* It reads the **built artefacts**, not the registry. Asking each surface to re-derive its
  own name list from ``REGISTRY`` and then comparing the three answers proves only that
  ``REGISTRY`` equals itself. The CLI list comes off the Typer app's command table, the
  REST list off the router's routes, the MCP list off the ``tools/list`` payload.
