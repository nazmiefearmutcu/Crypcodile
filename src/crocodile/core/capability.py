"""One declaration per capability, and the registry the symmetry gate reads.

Crypcodile expressed a single capability list three times: 5 499 lines of Typer CLI,
3 273 of FastAPI routes and 2 600 of MCP tool handlers — roughly 11 400 lines saying
one thing. Adding a second asset class to that shape means six monoliths and a promise
of full API symmetry that nobody can keep by hand. So a capability is declared once,
here, and Phase 2 makes the three surfaces projections of this registry rather than
three hand-maintained copies of it.

The promise being mechanised is: every capability available for one asset class is
available for the other under the same name and parameter schema, and always returns
data — where no free native equity source exists, a derived or synthetic method supplies
it while saying so. :data:`REGISTRY` is what makes the first half checkable and
:attr:`Impl.basis` is what makes the second half machine-readable.

This module holds the *machinery* and no declarations. The declarations live in
:mod:`crocodile.capabilities`, one batch module per family, because four agents fill that
package in parallel and a single file would serialise them. Keeping the two apart also
keeps this module free of every analytics import a declaration drags in, which is what
lets :class:`CapabilityContext` defer ``Catalog`` to ``TYPE_CHECKING``.

The registry ships with real capabilities rather than empty on purpose: a symmetry gate
over an empty registry is vacuously green, which is the same as not having one.

The defect this exists to make visible has shipped in this codebase before. ``slippage``
declared an equity half that was the crypto function bound twice: the declaration advertised
a ``yahoo_1m_vap`` ladder while the bound function read ``book_snapshot``, which no equity
provider writes, so every equity call raised and the symmetry gate reported a symmetric
capability. ``set(cap.impls) == {CRYPTO, EQUITY}`` — which is all Gate 2 asks — is satisfied
by two dict keys pointing at one callable, and a referee re-introduced exactly that against
``census`` and passed the entire 3 300-test suite.

So the gate asks for ``fn`` distinctness, and this is what tells it when sharing is the
answer rather than the bug. It is a declaration and not a heuristic on purpose: the two
states are indistinguishable from the outside. ``basis`` was the obvious guess and is wrong —
``iv-surface`` declares ``native`` on both sides, so does ``ofi``, so does ``indicators``,
and a gate keyed on "the two bases differ" would wave a rebind of the first two straight
through while flagging the third. Whether one implementation can serve two markets is a
claim about the capability, and a claim has to be made somewhere a reviewer reads.

Two arguments qualify, and both are about there being **one thing to read**:

- *One lake.* The ``catalog-*`` family and its neighbours answer about storage, not about a
  market. Both asset classes live in one set of partitions, so the asset class narrows a
  query rather than choosing a store, and :attr:`CapabilityContext.asset_class` is there for
  exactly that narrowing.
- *No lake.* ``funding-predict`` takes its inputs from ``params`` and opens nothing, which is
  the same argument :func:`crocodile.core.schema.provenance` registers as ``caller_supplied``.

What does **not** qualify is "the crypto one happens to run": that is the ``slippage``
failure, and it is the one this list must never be used to excuse. A capability that reads
market data has two markets' data to read, and one function cannot read both unless it was
written to — in which case it belongs here with that written down.

Membership is censused in ``tests/conformance/test_pending_symmetry.py`` for the reason every
ledger here is: an exemption list nobody counts is a place to put things. That census is not
an afterthought — an earlier review added a gate together with the exemption the gate itself
suggested, and the exemption is what the next deletion was laundered through.

Here so that :data:`PENDING_SYMMETRY` can only point at a plan that was actually written
down. A deadline that names a method nobody specified is a deadline nobody owns.

M1 to M7 are design §9.1's, and they share an assumption the design never states: that the
gap always runs equity-ward. Porting the surfaces found the counterexample. ``depth``
existed only for equities — M6 *is* its equity half, already built — so the half it was
missing was the **crypto** one, and the ledger had no vocabulary for that direction.
M8 is that vocabulary. It was not a new promise so much as an admission: crypto emits
``BookSnapshot`` records natively, so the ladder equities have to model was one crypto
already reported, and the only reason it was absent is that nobody had written it.

M8's confidence formula did not exist when M8 was written, and that was the whole of the
difficulty: a ladder sliced out of a stored venue book is neither ``native`` — the venue
published a book, at its own instant and to its own depth, not this ladder — nor
``book_resample``, which is a declared constant precisely because a resampler picks its own
boundary and so has no staleness and no unfillable request to score. The method named the
plan and the formula arrived with the implementation, which is the order the registry
requires. It is ``book_snapshot_slice`` in :mod:`crocodile.core.schema.provenance` — how
much of the requested ladder the store actually held, times how much of the caller's
declared staleness tolerance the answer used up — and with it ``depth`` became symmetric and
left :data:`PENDING_SYMMETRY` entirely rather than being remapped from M6 to M8. The ledger
forbids that remap on purpose: a method is the plan that closes a gap, so swapping one is a
re-plan rather than a correction, and a capability with both halves needs no schedule at
all.

"""Capabilities that are asymmetric *on schedule*, mapped to the method that closes them.

Phase 2 put 49 capabilities into :data:`REGISTRY` — 47 ported off the legacy surfaces by
the four batch modules, plus the two the parity gate found at its exit — with their crypto
halves working and their equity halves Phase 3 work. That leaves the symmetry gate three
possible futures and two of them are lies:

- **Do not register them until both halves exist.** The registry stops describing the
  product, and the surfaces cannot be projections of it, which is the whole of Phase 2.
- **Put them on** :data:`IRREDUCIBLE`. That mapping means *no equity analogue can exist* —
  a claim about the market. Using it for "not built yet" is exactly the scheduling excuse
  its justifications are tested against, and once a name is there nothing ever makes it
  leave.
- **Say so, with a deadline.** This.

The rules, each enforced by a gate in ``tests/conformance/test_pending_symmetry.py``:

1. every value names a method in :data:`SPEC_METHODS`;
2. a name may not be here and on :data:`IRREDUCIBLE` — those are opposite claims;
3. every name here must be registered and must actually be asymmetric, so the ledger
   cannot quietly hold names that no longer need it;
4. it must be **empty** at Phase 3's exit, which is what makes it a schedule rather than a
   second exemption list.

**The ``{}`` above is a declaration, not the runtime value, and no sentence here states
what the runtime value is.** :mod:`crocodile.capabilities.analytics`,
:mod:`~crocodile.capabilities.market` and :mod:`~crocodile.capabilities.ops` each call
``update()`` on this dict at import time, because four batches editing one dict in this
shared module is four merge conflicts in one file. So the declaration site shows ``{}``
whatever the ledger actually holds, and a reader who takes it at face value is wrong by
exactly the number of entries the batches added.

That gap has now produced the same defect twice, in opposite directions. "Empty today"
survived here for a whole phase while the batches filled the ledger to 21 entries. The
correction stated that count in the present tense — and then outlived the entries: Phase 3
discharged M1 through M8, every one of them left, and a paragraph written to stop a stale
count had become one. A sentence naming a number this module cannot see will go stale on
whichever side the ledger next moves, so this one names none.

What checks the number instead: ``_LEDGER_AS_SHIPPED`` in
``tests/conformance/test_pending_symmetry.py`` pins the contents entry by entry, and
``test_phase_3_exit_the_ledger_must_be_empty`` asserts the exit criterion against the live
dict. Between them the count is measured on every run.

The hazard this paragraph exists for does *not* go away while the ledger is empty — it is
dormant, which is worse, because the next reader sees ``{}`` and a docstring that agrees
with it. The moment a batch module schedules a capability again, this line still reads
``{}``, and the only things that will notice are the two tests above.

    :data:`CapabilityFn` is synchronous and some implementations are not, so this is the one
    bridge between the two — and it lives here, in the machinery, because writing it twice is
    how the second copy came to be wrong. The first copy is
    ``crocodile.capabilities.market``'s; the second was ``capabilities.onchain``'s ``_run``,
    a bare ``asyncio.run`` under a comment asserting that "both network surfaces call
    ``dispatch.invoke`` from a worker thread rather than from the event loop". Neither does.
    ``onchain-price`` worked on the CLI, returned 500 on REST and raised ``RuntimeError:
    asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`` on MCP — two surfaces out of
    three, from one line, for a whole phase.

    The two callers this has to serve are the reason it is not a bare ``asyncio.run``. A CLI
    projection has no running loop, so ``asyncio.run`` is exactly right. A REST or MCP
    projection *is* a running loop, and ``asyncio.run`` raises ``RuntimeError`` there —
    which makes the same declaration work on one surface and fail on another, the asymmetry

    That blocks the calling loop for the duration, which is a real cost and is stated rather
    than hidden: an async surface that does not want to pay it calls the adapter through
    ``asyncio.to_thread``, which puts it on a thread with no loop and takes the first
    branch. It cannot deadlock — every coroutine reaching this builds its own
    ``aiohttp``/``ccxt``/``web3`` session inside the new loop and awaits nothing belonging to

    not fail loudly, it would degrade into a registry quietly missing whatever came after
    it. Re-declaring a name the *same* declaring path already owns therefore replaces it
    instead of raising, while a *different* module claiming an existing name still goes
    through :func:`register` and still fails hard. That distinction is the whole point: an
    idempotent re-import is a mechanical fact, two modules claiming one name is a bug.
