"""One place that knows what an environment variable means.

Crypcodile read 16 environment variables and Stockodile 23, each at its point of
use, listed nowhere. ``Settings`` replaces that with one object and one prefix.
Legacy ``CRYPCODILE_*`` / ``STOCKODILE_*`` names are honoured for one minor
version, with a deprecation warning.

``Settings`` parses exactly as much as has a wrong answer. A flag becomes a
``bool`` here, because ``bool("false")`` is ``True`` and a reader that forgets is
wrong in the direction that turns a security control quietly on. Everything else
stays the string the environment supplied: splitting a comma-separated URL list
has no ambiguity for this module to resolve, so the caller keeps it.
