"""Dead-letter queue for unparseable / normalize-failed frames.

Items land here from ``Connector.run()`` so the supervised loop can continue.
On collect stop, callers drain the queue and optionally write a JSON report.

Why ``put`` is sync-but-awaitable
---------------------------------
The two forks shipped the same idea over different plumbing, and both spellings
are pinned by tests that cannot both be satisfied by a coroutine:

* Crypto's ``DeadLetterQueue.put`` was ``async``. ``crocodile.core.connector``
  awaits it from inside the supervised read loop, and ``tests/ingest/
  test_deadletter.py`` / ``tests/exchanges/test_base.py`` call
  ``await dlq.put(...)`` throughout.
* Equity's was synchronous, guarded by a ``threading.Lock``, and optionally
  backed by a SQLite file so dead letters survived a crash. ``tests/equity/
  test_ingest.py`` calls ``dlq.put(...)`` bare and then asserts on ``drain()``
  in the same synchronous test function.

Making ``put`` ``async`` loses the equity tests (the bare call returns an
un-awaited coroutine, nothing is enqueued, and ``drain()`` sees zero items).
Making it plain-sync loses the crypto call sites (``await None`` is a
``TypeError``). So ``put`` does its work synchronously and returns an
already-completed awaitable: the bare call enqueues and discards a cheap
sentinel, and ``await`` on it resolves immediately to ``None``. One class,
both contracts, no ``coroutine was never awaited`` warning either way.

The durable store and the ``max_size`` floor are equity's, kept because they
are real capability: ``db_path=None`` (the default, and what every crypto call
site uses) leaves the hot path a bare ``deque.append`` with no I/O, so crypto
behaviour is byte-for-byte what it was. Only a caller that opts into
``db_path`` pays the blocking SQLite write, which is why that write is not
offloaded to a thread — the fork it comes from ran it inline too, and moving it
would change the durability guarantee (a row is on disk before ``put``
returns).
