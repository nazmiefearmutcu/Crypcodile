"""Shared order-book sync primitives for multi-venue gap recovery.

``SyncResult``, :class:`OrderBookSync` and the buffer-filter helper are used by
:class:`~crocodile.core.ingest.gap_bridge.BookResyncBridge`.

:class:`OrderBookSync` is the generic ``U``/``u``/``pu`` implementation of
:class:`BookSyncMachine` — the update-id continuity rules Binance publishes and
that every venue speaking that dialect (including the equity providers) reuses
verbatim.  It used to live in ``exchanges/binance/book.py``; that module now
re-exports it, so both asset classes share one state machine rather than two
copies that can drift.

Venues whose continuity fields do *not* follow that dialect keep their own
implementation of :class:`BookSyncMachine` under ``exchanges/<venue>/book.py``:
OKX is wired via ``OkxOrderBookSync`` (``seqId`` / ``prevSeqId``) and
REST ``GET /market/books``.  Bybit is intentionally not wired yet — see
the deferral note on ``BybitConnector`` (REST ``u`` only aligns with
``orderbook.1000``, while the connector uses ``orderbook.50``; recovery
is re-snapshot, not Binance-style REST-anchored delta replay).
