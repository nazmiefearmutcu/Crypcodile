"""Provenance levels and the registry of confidence formulas.

Every record Crocodile writes declares how it came to exist. Where a value is
not reported natively by a venue, the method that produced it is named by
``prov_basis``, and that name is a key into this registry.

The registry exists to make one rule enforceable: a confidence number must be
a pure function of observable inputs, documented alongside its formula. Constants
chosen by feel are how honest provenance decays into decoration.

Confidence measures **sampling adequacy within a level**, not truthfulness
across levels. A synthetic profile built from a full session scores 1.0 because
it is fully sampled *as a synthetic profile*; ``prov`` is what says it is not a
real order book. The two fields answer different questions and neither
substitutes for the other. This is also why a confidence of 0.0 is not the same
claim as :attr:`Provenance.UNAVAILABLE`: an empty synthetic profile and an
absent one are distinguished by ``prov``, never by the number alone.

:func:`provenance_fields` is the only supported way to populate a record's four
``prov_*`` fields. Hand-assembling them bypasses the confidence formula, which
is exactly what this module exists to prevent.

    A bar is a *function* of the records handed to the resampler — every print in the
    bucket is in the open, high, low, close and volume, and none of them is estimated.
    What the bar might be missing is records the caller never supplied, and a resampler
    cannot observe a stream it was not given.

    The obvious counter-argument, and why it does not land here. ``high`` and ``low`` are
    order statistics over the supplied sample, so a one-quote minute yields
    ``open == high == low == close`` with ``volume = 0.0`` and still scores 1.0 — which is
    precisely the claim ``yahoo_1m_vap`` refuses for a three-bar profile. The difference is
    the denominator, not the sparsity. ``yahoo_1m_vap`` divides by 390 because a regular US
    session *contains* 390 one-minute bars whether or not any were fetched: the reference
    exists independently of the input, so "how much of it did we get" is answerable. A trade
    or quote stream has no such reference. How many prints a minute should hold is not a
    property of the market, it is whatever traded, and dividing by a number invented to
    stand for it would be the constant this registry exists to refuse, one indirection
    deeper.

    That is an argument for refusing to measure, not a claim that the sparsity does not
    matter — so the sparsity is reported where it can be reported honestly, as a count
    rather than a ratio: the bar carries ``num_trades``, which is the sample size, and for
    a quote bar it is the quote count. ``ohlcv_from_ohlcv`` is the case where the
    denominator *does* exist, because every input bar declares its own width, and that one
    is measured. The contrast is the argument: measure when the input declares a
    denominator, refuse to invent one when it does not.

    The claim that the bar was not reported by a venue is ``prov``'s, and it is the level

    ``min(covered_ns / tradeable_ns, 1.0) * min(sampled_ns / tradeable_ns, 1.0)``, where

    * ``sampled_ns`` is that same union with each instant weighted by the best
      ``prov_confidence`` covering it — *adequacy*, how well the covered part was
      sampled;
    * ``tradeable_ns`` is how much of the bucket the market could fill.

    **Why the denominator is not the bucket's width.** It was, and a *complete* regular
    US session — 390 one-minute bars, every one of them at confidence 1.0 — re-bucketed
    to 1d scored 0.2708, because 390 minutes of a 1440-minute calendar day is all a
    complete session can ever be. A consumer thresholding ``>= 0.5`` dropped every
    complete equity daily bar there is. ``yahoo_1m_vap`` in this same registry already
    divides by 390 for exactly this market and exactly this reason; wall-clock was never
    the reference, it was the reference for a market that never closes. So the caller
    declares the tradeable window, because only the caller knows the calendar. Today the
    only caller is the equity resampler and it passes regular sessions
    (``crocodile.equity.resample.ohlcv._tradeable_ns``); a market that never closes would
    pass the bucket width unchanged, which is what the old formula assumed of every
    market. Over-declaring the window — a holiday nobody modelled — lowers the score and
    never raises it, which is the safe direction for a number consumers filter on and the
    reason a full calendar is not a prerequisite for measuring at all.

    **Why the two terms are separate, and multiplied.** They used to be one: the width of
    each input was multiplied by its own confidence and the products summed, so 390 bars
    at 0.5 and 195 bars at 1.0 produced the identical number from different states. They
    are not the same state. Half-sampled inputs across a whole session still observed
    every minute's own high and low; a missing half-session observed nothing there, and
    the day's high may be absent from the bar entirely. A gap therefore fails both tests
    — the bar does not span the window, *and* the instants it does not span contribute no
    sampling — while dilution fails only the second. Multiplying charges it twice, which
    is the asymmetry the two states differ by: 390 at 0.5 scores 0.5, 195 at 1.0 scores
    0.25.

    **Why a union and not a sum.** ``covered_ns`` is a union of intervals because a lake
    spanning the migration holds the same day under two channel tags, and a summed width
    counted it twice — *raising* the confidence of a bar because one of its inputs was
    duplicated. A duplicate is the one thing that must never make a derivation look better
    sampled. Overlapping inputs contribute their instant once, at the best confidence
    covering it.

    Saturating at 1.0 in each term says the bucket is as covered, and as well sampled, as
    this method can make it. A caller re-bucketing wide bars into narrower ones passes
    more coverage than the bucket holds, and that is a full bucket, not an over-full one.
    The claim that the bar was not reported by a venue is ``prov``'s, and the emitted bar
    carries the worst level among its inputs (see :func:`worst_provenance`), so
    re-bucketing synthetic bars yields synthetic ones rather than laundering them.

    to whoever produced them and is not ours to assert; a lower number here would be this
    engine grading a stranger's data, which it cannot observe and must not guess at.

    lives in the basis *name*: ``WHERE prov_basis = 'caller_supplied'`` separates these

    one-minute bars whether or not any were fetched. This matters in practice rather than in

    ``min(n_levels / n_requested, 1.0) * (1 - age_ns / window_ns)``, where

    * ``n_levels`` counts the levels the stored snapshot actually put into the ladder, both
      sides together, after dead levels are dropped and the requested depth is applied;
    * ``n_requested`` is the ladder the caller asked for, ``2 * top_n``;
    * ``age_ns`` is how far *before* the instant the slice claims to describe the snapshot
      it was cut from was observed;
    * ``window_ns`` is how stale the caller said a book may be and still describe that
      instant.

    **Why neither neighbouring basis covers this, which is why it exists.** ``native`` says
    a venue reported this value. The venue reported *a book*, at its own instant and to
    whatever depth it was subscribed at; what a slice hands back is that book re-cut to a
    requested depth and re-stamped at a requested instant, and neither edit is the venue's.
    ``book_resample`` is the nearer miss and misses in the opposite direction: it is a
    declared constant because a boundary capture is exact at the instant it is stamped — the
    resampler *chooses* the boundary and flushes it before applying the record that crosses
    it, so nothing is left over to score. A slice chooses no instant. The caller names one
    and the lake holds whatever it holds at or before it, so the two deficiencies that are
    structurally impossible in a resampled capture are precisely the two that vary here.

    **Why the fill term does not contradict ``book_resample``'s note on truncation.** That
    entry argues, correctly, that ``top_n`` truncation is not a deficiency: a caller asking
    for five levels and receiving the best five has been answered. It holds the whole
    reconstructed book, so it can always answer. This does not: the truncation that matters
    happened upstream, at whatever depth the collector subscribed the venue's book at, and it
    is already in the Parquet file. Asking for twenty-five levels and receiving the ten the
    lake stored is not an answer trimmed to the request, it is a ladder the lake could not
    fill. So the two agree rather than disagree — this term is 1.0 in exactly the case
    ``book_resample`` describes, and below it only when the request outruns the store.

    **Why staleness is scored here and declined there.** ``book_resample`` declines it
    because a quiet interval is not an unsampled one: if no update arrives between two
    boundaries the book genuinely did not change, and there is no reference for how often a
    book ought to tick. That argument is about a *chosen* boundary. Here the record claims an
    instant the caller chose and was built from an observation made before it, and the gap
    between the two is not the market being quiet — it is this answer describing one moment
    with another moment's book.

    **Where the denominator comes from, and the one uncomfortable thing about it.**
    ``window_ns`` is declared by the caller, on ``ohlcv_from_ohlcv``'s precedent: only the
    caller knows what "still describes this instant" means for what they are doing, a minute
    for a risk report and a second for an execution decision. The precedent does not carry
    cleanly, and saying so is cheaper than pretending it does. Over-declaring
    ``tradeable_ns`` *lowers* that score, which is the safe direction; over-declaring
    ``window_ns`` raises this one, so a caller who widens their tolerance grades the same
    stale book higher. It is taken anyway because both alternatives are worse. The natural
    structural reference — the interval to the *next* stored snapshot — cannot be read
    without looking past the instant this record claims to describe, which
    :mod:`crocodile.core.resample.book` forbids and which this basis exists downstream of. A
    fixed constant would be a number invented to stand for how often a book ought to tick,
    which is the move ``_aggregate_of_an_undeclared_stream`` refuses one indirection out. The
    mitigation is that the number is read *relative to a claim the caller made*: widening the
    window weakens the claim as fast as it raises the score, and the age is recoverable from
    the emitted record by anyone who wants to re-grade it against a window of their own.

    That last clause was false for as long as it stood here, and it is the whole of what
    makes this denominator tolerable, so it is worth saying exactly what carries it.
    ``DepthProfile.local_ts`` is the *requested* instant — the slice re-stamps it — and
    ``source_ts`` is the venue's own clock, a different number wherever both exist and
    ``None`` for every Coinbase book. Neither is the stamp ``age_ns`` was measured from.
    ``DepthProfile.snapshot_ts`` is, and ``age_ns = local_ts - snapshot_ts`` reads off the
    row. Until that field existed a caller passing ``--max-age-ns 86400e9`` against an
    hour-old book got ``prov_confidence=0.958`` and no way to find the hour.

    **Why the terms multiply.** They are independent ways the same answer fails to be the
    book at the instant asked for — a ladder can be short, stale, or both — and a slice that
    is both is worse than either, which is what a product says and a mean does not. It is the
    same reasoning ``ohlcv_from_ohlcv`` gives for multiplying extent by adequacy, applied to
    depth and to time instead of to two halves of one window.

    **What is deliberately not an input.** Whether the stored snapshot was the venue's whole
    book or a truncated top-N is not observable from the record: ``BookSnapshot`` carries the
    levels it carries and no flag saying whether anything was cut, and a collector that
    subscribed twenty levels writes exactly what a venue that publishes twenty writes.
    Scoring it would mean guessing, and the fill term already measures the only consequence
    either case has — a stored ten asked for twenty-five scores 0.4 whichever of the two
    trimmed it.

    :attr:`Provenance.DERIVED`, the same level ``alpaca_l1`` and ``book_resample`` carry and
    the same one the equity half of ``depth`` declares. Every price and size in the ladder
    was published by the venue in a real book, so nothing here is modelled — which is what
    keeps it out of :attr:`Provenance.SYNTHETIC`, where ``yahoo_1m_vap`` sits because traded
    volume stands in for resting size and ``amm_tick_curve`` sits because liquidity in range
    stands in for orders anyone placed. Saturating the fill term at the requested depth says
    the ladder is as full as the store can make it, not that a slice has become a venue
    product; that claim is ``prov``'s, and it stays ``DERIVED`` at every value.

    * ``horizon_ns`` is the period the carry is annualised over — time to expiry for a
      dated future, time to the next dividend event for a holding cost.

    **Why three terms over three, rather than two factors multiplied.** The two price legs
    are stored prints: a leg is there or it is not, and a leg that is there was not
    partially observed. The yield leg is different in kind — it is always a *carried*
    number, because the Treasury publishes the par curve once per business day at 3:30pm
    ET while the price pair can be stamped at any instant, so the only honest question
    about it is how much of the period being priced it actually speaks to. Scoring each
    leg in ``[0, 1]`` and averaging says exactly that: three legs, two of them binary, one
    of them graded.

    **Why the horizon is the denominator, and why nothing else could be.** The temptation
    is to divide the yield's age by the Treasury's publication interval — one business day
    — which would say a same-session quote is perfect and a Monday quote used on Wednesday
    is two-thirds stale. That number is about the *feed*, and this registry has refused
    that shape before: ``_aggregate_of_an_undeclared_stream`` declines to invent a
    denominator for how often a stream ought to tick. The rate here is not being reported,
    it is being *applied across a horizon*, and the horizon is declared by the caller from
    the contract's own expiry. A quote published a day before a 90-day carry misses a
    ninetieth of what it is being used to price; the same quote against a two-day carry
    misses half of it. Same staleness, different consequence, and the consequence is what
    a consumer filtering on this number needs.

    Saturating at zero rather than going negative says a yield older than the whole
    horizon speaks to none of the period being priced — the same information content as no
    yield at all, which is why an absent leg is passed in as ``yield_age_ns ==
    horizon_ns`` rather than given a fourth term of its own. Absence and total staleness
    are the same claim here, and a fourth term would let them disagree.

    :attr:`Provenance.DERIVED` and not :attr:`Provenance.SYNTHETIC`. Every number that
    goes in was reported by somebody: the derivative's price by its venue, the cash leg by

    side of. Not :attr:`Provenance.NATIVE` either, and this is the whole reason the basis
    exists: no venue publishes an equity carry, and the header default would have said one
    did.

    The honest caveat, stated because the basis name invites it: a Treasury par yield is a
    *proxy* for the rate an actual carry trade finances at, which is a repo rate and is
    not published keylessly. The emitted rows carry ``risk_free_rate``,
    ``risk_free_tenor_days`` and ``risk_free_date`` beside the carry, so which published

    """A quarter-end position: how much of the statutory 45 days it was withheld for.

    ``max(1 - disclosure_lag_days / 45, 0.0)``, where ``disclosure_lag_days`` counts calendar
    days from the quarter end the table describes to the day the filing became public. A table
    filed the day after quarter end was invisible for one of the days Rule 13f-1 permits it to
    be invisible and scores 44/45; one filed at the deadline scores 0.0, and an amendment
    landing later clamps there.

    **Why this is a sampling measure and not a complaint about lateness.**
    ``_book_resample`` in this same registry declines to score staleness, and its two reasons
    are the right test to apply. The first: "absence of updates is not absence of sampling" —
    a quiet book genuinely did not change. That leg fails here. A withheld 13F describes a
    portfolio that *existed* through the whole interval and that no one outside the manager
    could observe; the position is not quiet, it is hidden, and an interval in which a real
    fact was unobservable is unsampled by any reading of the word. The second: scoring it
    "would need a reference for how often a book ought to tick, and no such reference
    exists". That leg fails too, and more plainly — Rule 13f-1(a) wrote the reference down.
    45 days is not a denominator invented to make a constant look measured; it is the window
    a regulator set, and it exists whether or not any filer uses it, in the way a regular US
    session contains 390 one-minute bars whether or not ``yahoo_1m_vap`` fetched any.

    **Why the lag and not the form's own boxes**, which is what ``sec_form4`` scores. An
    information table's Column 5 value and Column 4 share count are mandatory and are
    present on essentially every row; there is nothing partial about them to grade. What is
    partial is the *time* the row speaks for: the table states a position at one instant and
    publishes no date for a single one of the trades that built it, so a quarter of activity
    arrives as one undated number. That is the deficiency worth measuring, and the lag is the
    part of it that is observable per record.

    0.0 at the deadline is the reading ``unavailable`` and ``scraped_last_price`` carry and
    means what it means there: no sampling evidence — here, none *for the present*. It is not
    a claim that the position is false. The claim that a filer really reported these numbers
    is ``prov``'s, and it stays :attr:`Provenance.NATIVE` at every value.

    """Resampled book depth: 1.0, because the capture is exact at the instant it is stamped.

    The reconstruction has nothing estimated in it. The engine replays absolute levels
    from a real venue snapshot and raises ``BookGap`` rather than guessing across a
    sequence break, so a capture at boundary *B* is the book as the stream reported it at
    *B*, level for level.

    **This was a formula, and the formula is why it stopped being one.** It read
    ``max(1 - lookahead_ns / interval_ns, 0.0)``, and its whole observable was the crypto
    resampler's own boundary rule: that rule applied the boundary-crossing record *before*
    capturing, so a snapshot stamped 10:00:00 could contain an update from 10:00:00.200 and
    scored itself 0.8 on the way into the lake. The two resamplers have been collapsed onto
    the ordering that flushes boundaries below a record *before* applying it
    (``crocodile.core.resample.book``), which makes ``lookahead_ns`` structurally zero at
    every capture — so the formula could only ever return 1.0. A number that cannot move is
    a constant, and a constant spelled as a division is a constant in the one place no
    call-site gate looks. It is declared here instead, and
    ``tests/conformance/test_gates.py::CONSTANT_BY_DEFINITION`` carries the same argument
    where Gate 3c can check it.

    Nothing was silently dropped in the trade. What used to be scored is now refused:
    ``_capture_snapshot`` raises :class:`~crocodile.core.errors.ProvenanceError` if it is
    ever handed a book holding an update stamped after the boundary. Emitting a biased bar
    at 0.0 is how they reached the lake; not building the record is the loud form.

    **The tempting replacement, and why it is not taken.** Staleness — how long before the
    boundary the last update landed — is observable and does vary. It is not a sampling
    deficiency: if no update arrives between two boundaries the book genuinely did not
    change, and absence of updates is not absence of sampling. Scoring it would need a
    reference for how often a book *ought* to tick, and no such reference exists; it would
    be a denominator invented to make a constant look measured, which is the move
    ``_aggregate_of_an_undeclared_stream`` refuses one indirection out.

    ``top_n`` truncation is not a deficiency either. A caller asking for five levels and
    receiving the best five has been answered, not under-sampled; the emitted ``depth``
    says how many levels the record carries.

    1.0 is a claim about sampling within this level, not about the record being a venue
    product. That claim is ``prov``'s, and it stays :attr:`Provenance.DERIVED`.
