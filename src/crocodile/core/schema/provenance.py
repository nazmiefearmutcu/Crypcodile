"""Provenance levels and the registry of confidence formulas.

Every record Crocodile writes declares how it came to exist. Where a value is
not reported natively by a venue, the method that produced it is named by
``prov_basis``, and that name is a key into this registry.

The registry exists to make one rule enforceable: a confidence number must be
a pure function of observable inputs, documented alongside its formula. Constants
chosen by feel are how honest provenance decays into decoration.

Confidence measures **sampling adequacy within a level**, not truthfulness
across levels. A synthetic profile built from a full session scores 1.0 because
it is fully sampled *as a synthetic profile*; ``prov`` is what says it is not a
real order book. The two fields answer different questions and neither
substitutes for the other. This is also why a confidence of 0.0 is not the same
claim as :attr:`Provenance.UNAVAILABLE`: an empty synthetic profile and an
absent one are distinguished by ``prov``, never by the number alone.

:func:`provenance_fields` is the only supported way to populate a record's four
``prov_*`` fields. Hand-assembling them bypasses the confidence formula, which
is exactly what this module exists to prevent.

    A bar is a *function* of the records handed to the resampler — every print in the
    bucket is in the open, high, low, close and volume, and none of them is estimated.
    What the bar might be missing is records the caller never supplied, and a resampler
    cannot observe a stream it was not given.

    The obvious counter-argument, and why it does not land here. ``high`` and ``low`` are
    order statistics over the supplied sample, so a one-quote minute yields
    ``open == high == low == close`` with ``volume = 0.0`` and still scores 1.0 — which is
    precisely the claim ``yahoo_1m_vap`` refuses for a three-bar profile. The difference is
    the denominator, not the sparsity. ``yahoo_1m_vap`` divides by 390 because a regular US
    session *contains* 390 one-minute bars whether or not any were fetched: the reference
    exists independently of the input, so "how much of it did we get" is answerable. A trade
    or quote stream has no such reference. How many prints a minute should hold is not a
    property of the market, it is whatever traded, and dividing by a number invented to
    stand for it would be the constant this registry exists to refuse, one indirection
    deeper.

    That is an argument for refusing to measure, not a claim that the sparsity does not
    matter — so the sparsity is reported where it can be reported honestly, as a count
    rather than a ratio: the bar carries ``num_trades``, which is the sample size, and for
    a quote bar it is the quote count. ``ohlcv_from_ohlcv`` is the case where the
    denominator *does* exist, because every input bar declares its own width, and that one
    is measured. The contrast is the argument: measure when the input declares a
    denominator, refuse to invent one when it does not.

    The claim that the bar was not reported by a venue is ``prov``'s, and it is the level

    ``min(covered_ns / tradeable_ns, 1.0) * min(sampled_ns / tradeable_ns, 1.0)``, where

    * ``sampled_ns`` is that same union with each instant weighted by the best
      ``prov_confidence`` covering it — *adequacy*, how well the covered part was
      sampled;
    * ``tradeable_ns`` is how much of the bucket the market could fill.

    **Why the denominator is not the bucket's width.** It was, and a *complete* regular
    US session — 390 one-minute bars, every one of them at confidence 1.0 — re-bucketed
    to 1d scored 0.2708, because 390 minutes of a 1440-minute calendar day is all a
    complete session can ever be. A consumer thresholding ``>= 0.5`` dropped every
    complete equity daily bar there is. ``yahoo_1m_vap`` in this same registry already
    divides by 390 for exactly this market and exactly this reason; wall-clock was never
    the reference, it was the reference for a market that never closes. So the caller
    declares the tradeable window, because only the caller knows the calendar. Today the
    only caller is the equity resampler and it passes regular sessions
    (``crocodile.equity.resample.ohlcv._tradeable_ns``); a market that never closes would
    pass the bucket width unchanged, which is what the old formula assumed of every
    market. Over-declaring the window — a holiday nobody modelled — lowers the score and
    never raises it, which is the safe direction for a number consumers filter on and the
    reason a full calendar is not a prerequisite for measuring at all.

    **Why the two terms are separate, and multiplied.** They used to be one: the width of
    each input was multiplied by its own confidence and the products summed, so 390 bars
    at 0.5 and 195 bars at 1.0 produced the identical number from different states. They
    are not the same state. Half-sampled inputs across a whole session still observed
    every minute's own high and low; a missing half-session observed nothing there, and
    the day's high may be absent from the bar entirely. A gap therefore fails both tests
    — the bar does not span the window, *and* the instants it does not span contribute no
    sampling — while dilution fails only the second. Multiplying charges it twice, which
    is the asymmetry the two states differ by: 390 at 0.5 scores 0.5, 195 at 1.0 scores
    0.25.

    **Why a union and not a sum.** ``covered_ns`` is a union of intervals because a lake
    spanning the migration holds the same day under two channel tags, and a summed width
    counted it twice — *raising* the confidence of a bar because one of its inputs was
    duplicated. A duplicate is the one thing that must never make a derivation look better
    sampled. Overlapping inputs contribute their instant once, at the best confidence
    covering it.

    Saturating at 1.0 in each term says the bucket is as covered, and as well sampled, as
    this method can make it. A caller re-bucketing wide bars into narrower ones passes
    more coverage than the bucket holds, and that is a full bucket, not an over-full one.
    The claim that the bar was not reported by a venue is ``prov``'s, and the emitted bar
    carries the worst level among its inputs (see :func:`worst_provenance`), so
    re-bucketing synthetic bars yields synthetic ones rather than laundering them.

    which is what ``prov_confidence`` measures. The sampling story of the inputs belongs
    to whoever produced them and is not ours to assert; a lower number here would be this
    engine grading a stranger's data, which it cannot observe and must not guess at.

    So the level stays :attr:`Provenance.NATIVE` and the value stays 1.0, and the honesty
    lives in the basis *name*: ``WHERE prov_basis = 'caller_supplied'`` separates these
    from anything the lake produced, which ``native`` could not.

    a quiet book genuinely did not change. That leg fails here. A withheld 13F describes a
    portfolio that *existed* through the whole interval and that no one outside the manager
    could observe; the position is not quiet, it is hidden, and an interval in which a real
    fact was unobservable is unsampled by any reading of the word. The second: scoring it
    "would need a reference for how often a book ought to tick, and no such reference
    exists". That leg fails too, and more plainly — Rule 13f-1(a) wrote the reference down.
    45 days is not a denominator invented to make a constant look measured; it is the window
    a regulator set, and it exists whether or not any filer uses it, in the way a regular US

    **Why the lag and not the form's own boxes**, which is what ``sec_form4`` scores. An
    information table's Column 5 value and Column 4 share count are mandatory and are
    present on essentially every row; there is nothing partial about them to grade. What is
    partial is the *time* the row speaks for: the table states a position at one instant and

    The reconstruction has nothing estimated in it. The engine replays absolute levels
    from a real venue snapshot and raises ``BookGap`` rather than guessing across a
    sequence break, so a capture at boundary *B* is the book as the stream reported it at
    *B*, level for level.

    **This was a formula, and the formula is why it stopped being one.** It read
    ``max(1 - lookahead_ns / interval_ns, 0.0)``, and its whole observable was the crypto
    resampler's own boundary rule: that rule applied the boundary-crossing record *before*
    capturing, so a snapshot stamped 10:00:00 could contain an update from 10:00:00.200 and
    scored itself 0.8 on the way into the lake. The two resamplers have been collapsed onto
    the ordering that flushes boundaries below a record *before* applying it
    (``crocodile.core.resample.book``), which makes ``lookahead_ns`` structurally zero at
    every capture — so the formula could only ever return 1.0. A number that cannot move is
    a constant, and a constant spelled as a division is a constant in the one place no
    call-site gate looks. It is declared here instead, and
    ``tests/conformance/test_gates.py::CONSTANT_BY_DEFINITION`` carries the same argument
    where Gate 3c can check it.

    Nothing was silently dropped in the trade. What used to be scored is now refused:
    ``_capture_snapshot`` raises :class:`~crocodile.core.errors.ProvenanceError` if it is
    ever handed a book holding an update stamped after the boundary. Emitting a biased bar
    at 0.0 is how they reached the lake; not building the record is the loud form.

    **The tempting replacement, and why it is not taken.** Staleness — how long before the
    boundary the last update landed — is observable and does vary. It is not a sampling
    deficiency: if no update arrives between two boundaries the book genuinely did not
    change, and absence of updates is not absence of sampling. Scoring it would need a
    reference for how often a book *ought* to tick, and no such reference exists; it would
    be a denominator invented to make a constant look measured, which is the move
    ``_aggregate_of_an_undeclared_stream`` refuses one indirection out.

    ``top_n`` truncation is not a deficiency either. A caller asking for five levels and
    receiving the best five has been answered, not under-sampled; the emitted ``depth``
    says how many levels the record carries.

    1.0 is a claim about sampling within this level, not about the record being a venue
    product. That claim is ``prov``'s, and it stays :attr:`Provenance.DERIVED`.
