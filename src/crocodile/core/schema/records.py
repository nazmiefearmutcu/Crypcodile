"""Canonical record types.

Every record leads with the ten fields of :class:`_Header`: the four that identify an
observation, ``asset_class``, ``source_ts``, and the four-field provenance tail. All ten
live on the base and no record can restate or reorder them.

``kw_only=True`` on each record is what makes that possible. msgspec forbids a required
field after a defaulted one, which would otherwise force every struct to repeat the
defaulted tail after its own required fields; keyword-only fields are exempt, and the
base's fields stay positional so they keep leading. The pairing is load-bearing in both
directions: ``kw_only`` on the base instead would order the subclass's fields first and
silently break the header. ``tests/conformance/test_gates.py`` enforces both halves.
