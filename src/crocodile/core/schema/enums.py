This maps structs, not directories. ``Bar`` collapsed into ``OHLCV`` and ``OptionQuote``
into ``OptionsChain``, so a row on disk carrying ``channel='bar'`` has to decode into
something, and :mod:`crocodile.core.store.rows` uses this table to decide what. Without
it ``replay(["bar"])`` raised ``ValueError: Unknown channel tag: 'bar'`` and every row in
a ``channel=bar/`` directory was unreachable through the record API — which is the loss
this exists to prevent.

**A retired tag stays its own channel on disk.** ``channel=bar/`` is read by asking for
``bar``; ``channel=ohlcv/`` by asking for ``ohlcv``. Three review rounds tried instead to
make ``ohlcv`` silently cover both directories, and every one of them broke: first
duplicate rows and an inventory that reported eight of five, then a
``(symbol, local_ts, interval)`` dedup key that discarded 249 bars of a 250-bar Yahoo
history — that provider stamps a whole fetched history with one ``local_ts``, and the key
carried no ``source``. Transparency is what forces the deduplication, and deduplication
needs a cross-provider row identity this data does not support.

Rewriting the directory name is :mod:`crocodile.core.store.migrate`'s job — ``crocodile
migrate-lake`` renames partitions and rewrites no Parquet byte, and it is where the
design puts the tag rename (Phase 4). Reads report the tags that are on disk, honestly:
a lake holding both directories holds both channels, with the true row count for each.
