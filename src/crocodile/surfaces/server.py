"""The deployable REST server: the projection's routes, plus the ones that operate it.

:mod:`crocodile.surfaces.rest` builds *only* the capability routes, because Gate 4 compares
its route table to the registry and a hand-written route in there would read as an invented
capability. This module mounts that app's routes and adds the operational ones beside them,
which is what ``crocodile api`` actually serves.

The operational routes are the ones the surface inventory classified as infrastructure,
minus two that are not being carried across:

``GET /api/events`` emitted ``round(2000 + random.random() * 100, 2)`` every two seconds to
animate the demo dashboard. Porting it would mean porting the fabrication — the inventory's
own words — and the dashboard it animated went with the Node portal.

The x402 *verification* path is gone with the one route it gated; see
:mod:`crocodile.surfaces.payments`. ``simulate-payment`` and ``admin/payments`` stay,
because administering the ledger is a real operation on the installation.

``/docs`` is FastAPI's own Swagger UI now rather than a hand-themed copy of it. Both forks
set ``docs_url=None`` and re-served it with 224 lines of inline CSS pointing at a CDN; the
theme is not a contract, and a hand-rolled ``<head>`` rewrite is a page that stops rendering
the next time that CDN moves.
