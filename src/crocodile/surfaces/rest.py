"""The REST surface, projected: one route per capability under ``/api/v1``.

Replaces 3 273 lines of hand-written crypto routes and 1 500 of equity ones. It also
replaces ``GET /api/v1/capabilities``, which was a hand-copied list of route strings
sitting beside the routes it described — fifty-odd names maintained by remembering to.
Here the same route is the registry, so it cannot be stale.

FastAPI is imported inside :func:`build_app`, not at module scope. It lives in the ``web``
extra, and a module that cannot be imported on the base install would break the import gate
in ``tests/conformance/test_import_safety.py`` — an optional dependency is allowed to be
absent, but not at import time.

Trust posture: this is the network surface. Raw SQL is vetted and reads are capped at
:data:`~crocodile.surfaces.dispatch.NETWORK_ROW_LIMIT`, and the cap is published in the
provenance block so a truncated answer reads as a ceiling rather than as the whole lake.

The response envelope
---------------------
Every route answers ``{"rows": [...]}`` or ``{"result": ...}``, plus ``provenance`` and,
when the answer is not a native observation, ``warning``. Some legacy routes returned the
payload bare — ``GET /api/v1/slippage`` was a one-element array, so ``resp.json()[0]`` used
to work and now raises ``KeyError: 0``. The envelope stays, because ``provenance`` and the
SYNTHETIC banner are the whole point of the projection and a bare array has nowhere to put
them: an answer that does not say it was modelled is the failure this package exists to
end. The place a caller is told is the published schema — :func:`_openapi_responses` puts
the envelope in ``responses.200`` for every route, derived from :class:`ReturnKind` — and
the ``/docs`` page renders it.

    Every capability answers ``POST``, because a body is the only transport with no length
    limit and the caller is the one who knows their statement is 20 kB. Six routes the forks
    served on ``POST`` were ``GET``-only here and answered 405 — the frozen fixture records
    them, and the parity scanner strips the method before comparing, which is why no gate
    saw it. Retrying ``query`` as a GET is not a workaround: nginx's default
    ``large_client_header_buffers`` is 8 k, so a real statement 414s, and whatever does fit
    is written to access logs and browser history.

    A capability additionally answers ``GET`` when every parameter can be spelled in a URL.
    The four that cannot — ``gas-vol``, ``mev-sandwich``, ``smart-money``,
    ``label-transfers``, whose parameters are arrays of objects — are ``POST``-only, so a
    GET gets a 405 naming the method that works instead of a 400 about a field the caller
    had no way to send. That is also exactly what both forks served for them.

    :func:`dispatch.structured_fields` is the whole rule and it reads the parameter
    declaration. A list of capability names in this file would be the fourth copy of the
    registry, and it would be wrong the first time a parameter changed type.

    :class:`ReturnKind` was the other candidate and is deliberately not used. ``STREAM`` is
    the one thing the registry can identify as not-a-read, but a ``STREAM`` on this surface
    is refused by the read-only posture before it can hold anything, and ``backfill`` and
    ``export`` write too without being one — so keying on it would buy an inconsistency
    rather than a rule. What would settle it properly is a *capability* that declares it
    mutates the lake, which the registry does not have and this projection cannot invent.

disagreement this fixes was exactly that. The document said ``{"type": "array"}`` and the

key: ``?rates=0.001&rates=0.002&rates=0.003&rates=0.004`` answered 200 with
``predicted_funding_rate: 0.004`` and ``n_history: 1``. A client that read the published
schema and did what it said got a wrong number and no error.

The wire is what was made to agree with the schema, not the other way round: repeated keys
are what the OpenAPI default *means*, every generated client already emits them, and the
comma form the two forks served — ``?symbols=BTC,ETH`` — keeps working underneath because
:func:`dispatch.build_params` splits a single string on commas. So a repeated key and a
comma list are both accepted and both mean the same thing, and only one of them has to be
