"""The MCP surface, projected: one tool per capability.

Replaces 2 600 lines of hand-written crypto tool handlers and 800 of equity ones, and the
``_CAPABILITIES_MCP_TOOLS_HINT`` list that was a third hand-maintained copy of the same
names sitting inside the REST server.

Deliberately transport-free. This module produces the two things a JSON-RPC server needs —
a ``tools/list`` payload and a ``tools/call`` implementation — and nothing that speaks a
socket. A projection whose only entry point is a running server can only be tested by
starting one, which is how the legacy MCP handlers ended up with almost no coverage.

Trust posture: MCP is a network surface and is treated exactly as REST is — raw SQL vetted,
reads capped, cap published. The two agreeing is the point; they disagreed before, with
MCP passing ``readonly=True`` and REST wrapping a ``LIMIT``, each having independently
solved half the problem.

    ``inputSchema`` is the params struct's own schema with the top-level ``$ref`` followed,
    because ``$ref`` at the root of an ``inputSchema`` is a form MCP clients do not read: the
    properties they offer a model come from ``properties``, and the previous version wrote
    ``setdefault("properties", {})`` beside the ``$ref`` — inserting an **empty object** next
    to the reference rather than resolving it. All 57 tools therefore published a tool with no
    inputs at all. ``$defs`` is carried through unchanged so any nested reference inside the
    followed schema still resolves; the reference is followed once, in
    :func:`dispatch.params_schema`, which is the same function the REST projection uses for
    its query parameters, so this is not a second description of the parameters.

    ``asset_class`` is added on top, because it is the one input a caller may supply that
    is not a capability parameter: it selects the implementation rather than describing the
    request. It was in neither the schema, the description nor the error text, and for the 32
    wire names with two implementations and no symbol field it is the *only* thing that makes
    the call answerable — so an agent reading the published contract could not call them, and
    found out with a 400. It is listed as required for exactly those.
