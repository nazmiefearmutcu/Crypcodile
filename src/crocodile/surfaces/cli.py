"""The CLI, projected: one Typer command per capability, options from its params struct.

Replaces 5 499 lines of hand-written crypto Typer commands and 1 100 of equity ones with a
loop. There is no per-capability branch anywhere below, and there must never be: a command
that needs special handling in this file is a capability whose declaration is wrong.

The CLI's trust posture is the permissive one. It runs on the machine that owns the lake,
under the operator's own account, so raw SQL is not vetted and results are not capped —
which is also the only posture that keeps working, since the crypto CLI legitimately
reaches ``Catalog.query`` with SQL that :func:`assert_readonly_sql` rejects (see its
docstring on ``get_available_option_underlyings``). That is a decision about *this
surface*, made once here, rather than an omission repeated at forty-eight call sites.
