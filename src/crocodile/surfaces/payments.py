"""The x402 payment ledger and the rate limiter, which are process concerns, not queries.

Both forks carried a copy of this — an on-disk JSON ledger of payment ids, a sliding-window
limiter, and one paid route gated on a signature recovered from the payment id. It is here,
once, because ``simulate-payment`` and ``admin/payments`` are the two routes the surface
inventory classified as infrastructure rather than capabilities, and they need somewhere to
keep the ledger they administer.

What did **not** come across is the on-chain half: ``get_market_data`` verified a USDC
transfer on Base by fetching the receipt over RPC with a five-attempt failover, matching the
Transfer topic against a hardcoded contract address, and comparing the amount to
``PRICE_USDC``. That verification existed to gate exactly one route — the Base DEX price —
and that route is not in the registry, so the verifier now has nothing to admit anyone to.
Keeping four hundred lines of chain-state matching for a door with no room behind it is how
a codebase grows a second, unexercised copy of its trust model. The ledger stays because the
two administration routes stay; the door does not.

The store deliberately re-reads the file on every access rather than caching. Two processes
share one ledger — the REST server and whatever marks a payment paid — and a cached view is
how the same payment id gets served twice.
