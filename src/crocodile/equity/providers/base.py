class PullProvider(Provider):
    """A source that is *fetched* rather than subscribed to, wired into the same registry.

    :class:`Provider` is a supervised websocket run loop: :meth:`run` connects a transport,
    sends a subscribe frame, and drains frames through :meth:`normalize` into the sink,
    reconnecting with backoff. Four equity sources have no wire of that shape at all — the
    Treasury publishes one CSV per calendar year, SEC EDGAR serves an index and a document
    per filing, Yahoo answers one option chain per expiry, Tiingo one price series per
    request — and for each of them ``normalize`` is ``return ()``, ``_subscribe`` is
    ``pass`` and ``list_instruments`` is the requested symbols echoed back.

    Those three no-ops are the reason all four shipped as bare clients outside
    ``factory._REGISTRY``, and the argument was recorded at the time: writing them out four
    more times is four copies of an ABC being satisfied rather than used. It was the right
    objection and the wrong conclusion. Being outside the registry is not a stylistic
    preference — it is what made ``options_chain``, ``macro_series`` and ``insider`` channels
    that eleven shipped equity capability implementations *read* and that no shipped ingest
    path could *write*, so ``iv-surface``, ``open-interest``, ``perp-basis`` and
    ``whale-alerts`` returned zero rows on every lake this product can build, and
    ``spot-future-basis`` returned a row whose ``carry_pct`` was null under a
    ``prov_confidence`` of 0.667. ``holding_13f`` was the same absence with nothing pointed
    at it: ``smart-money``'s equity half differences information tables handed to it in
    ``params``, so the channel could stay unwritten without any capability visibly failing,
    which is the version of this defect no gate over *reads* can see.

    So the three no-ops are written once, here, with the argument, and the four sources join
    the registry that ``collect`` and ``backfill`` resolve against. What remains genuinely
    per-source — which channels it serves, and how a fetch turns into records — is what each
    subclass states.

    The second half of the original objection was the load-bearing one:
    :data:`~crocodile.equity.providers.factory.VALID_CHANNELS` was a hand-written list
    offered as a menu for *every* provider, so adding ``macro_series`` to it would have
    offered ``macro_series`` for ``alpaca`` — precisely the dead channel
    ``tests/conformance/test_provider_channels.py`` exists to stop the picker walking a user
    into. That is answered on the other side: the vocabulary is now derived from what the
    registered providers declare, every registered provider declares, and the menu narrows
    to the chosen one. See :data:`~crocodile.equity.providers.factory.VALID_CHANNELS`.

    :meth:`run` stays unimplemented here. A pull source is not automatically pollable — a
    curve that is republished once per business day, or a filing index that changes when
    somebody files, is a thing to *backfill*, and a poll loop over it would spend a rate
    limit re-reading yesterday. Subclasses that genuinely have a live snapshot to
    re-read — Yahoo's option chain is one — override it; the rest inherit a refusal that
    names the verb that does work, the way ``msn_money`` already did by hand.
