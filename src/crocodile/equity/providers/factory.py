The last four joined it late, and being outside it is what the defect *was*: eleven shipped
equity capability implementations read ``options_chain``, ``macro_series`` and ``insider``,
and no shipped ingest path could write any of them, because these four sources were plain
clients that ``make_provider`` had never heard of. See
:class:`~crocodile.equity.providers.base.PullProvider` for why they were clients and what
changed.

Imports here are eager, which is what lets :data:`VALID_CHANNELS` be *derived* from the
classes rather than hand-written. That trade only holds while a connector module is cheap
to import, so a connector whose dependencies are not — ``yahoo`` pulls ``yfinance`` and
``pandas``, about 1.2s, against a 0.46s CLI import — defers its own client import into its
constructor rather than making this registry lazy.

    The old list was four names — ``trade``, ``quote``, ``bar``, ``ohlcv`` — and it was
    offered as the channel menu for *every* provider, including the ones that declared

    *flatness*, not in the length. A vocabulary that is the union of per-provider
    declarations, narrowed back to the chosen provider by :func:`channels_for_provider`,

    Parameters
    ----------
    provider:
        Lowercase provider name. Valid values: ``alpaca``, ``finnhub``,
        ``google_finance``, ``msn_money``, ``sec_edgar``, ``stooq``, ``tiingo``,
        ``treasury``, ``yahoo`` — ``_REGISTRY`` below spelled out, with

        The last four arrived when the argument for keeping them out was measured and
        found to cost more than it bought. It ran: they are plain HTTP clients rather
        than supervised run loops, and registering one would add its channel to
        :data:`VALID_CHANNELS`, which was the CLI's channel menu for *every* provider —
        so ``macro_series`` would be offered for ``alpaca``. Both halves were true. What
        neither accounted for is that ``collect``, ``collect-market`` and ``backfill``
        resolve their sources through this registry, so a client outside it is a client
        no shipped command can reach — and eleven equity capabilities read channels only
        those clients write. The menu was the fixable half: :data:`VALID_CHANNELS` is now
        derived from each provider's own ``supported_channels`` rather than being one
        flat list, so a channel is offered for the providers that serve it and nowhere
        else. ``openfigi`` stays out; it enriches a universe and writes no channel. See
        :mod:`crocodile.equity.providers.treasury.client` for the argument in full.
    symbols:
        List of symbol strings to subscribe to.
    channels:
        List of canonical channel names (e.g. ``"trade"``, ``"ohlcv"``). ``"bar"`` is
        still accepted by the connectors that predate the struct collapse, but it is a
        retired tag, not a canonical one, and nothing writes it any more. A connector
        that declares :attr:`~crocodile.equity.providers.base.Provider.supported_channels`
        warns for each name outside its set and refuses the run when none survives, so
        ``google_finance`` with ``["quote"]`` raises here rather than polling forever
        and returning nothing; :func:`supported_channels` answers the same question
        without constructing anything.
    out:
        Sink to receive normalised records.
    registry:
        Instrument registry for symbol resolution.
    settings:
        The resolved environment, forwarded only to connectors that declare
        :attr:`~crocodile.equity.providers.base.Provider.wants_settings`. Opt-in because
        most connectors need nothing from configuration and would carry a parameter they
        ignore; the two that do — ``sec_edgar``'s contactable User-Agent and ``tiingo``'s
        token — are credentials a *surface* owns, and passing
        :attr:`CapabilityContext.settings
        <crocodile.core.capability.CapabilityContext.settings>` here is what stops a
        deployment configured from anywhere but ``os.environ`` being quietly ignored by
        the ingest layer.
    **kw:
        Extra keyword arguments forwarded verbatim to the provider constructor.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If *provider* is not a recognised name, or if the connector declares its
