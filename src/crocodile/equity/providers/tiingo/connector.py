"""Tiingo as a registered provider: keyed EOD and intraday bars, and no option chain.

The fourth of the four clients that had no shipped call site. Unlike the other three it
closes no gap in the read/write asymmetry: everything it can write —
:class:`~crocodile.core.schema.records.OHLCV` and the corporate actions Tiingo returns
inline — ``stooq`` and ``msn_money`` already write keylessly. What it adds is a second
opinion on the same channel from a source with a published adjustment methodology, which is
worth having and is not worth pretending is more than it is.

**Its option chain is the honest unavailable case.**
:meth:`TiingoClient.fetch_option_chain` raises ``NotImplementedError``, and that is not an
oversight to be fixed here: Tiingo's options data is a paid add-on on top of a paid plan,
and this codebase's promise is that a capability answers on free sources. So
``options_chain`` is declared unservable *with the reason*, and the channel is closed for
equities by ``yahoo``, which is keyless. Nothing about this provider is on the critical
path of the defect it was named in.

**It is keyed, and the key comes from configuration.** ``stooq`` and ``msn_money`` read
``os.environ`` inside their own constructors; this one sets
:attr:`~crocodile.equity.providers.base.Provider.wants_settings` and is handed the resolved
:class:`~crocodile.core.config.Settings` by the factory, so a surface configured from
anywhere other than the process environment is actually obeyed.
