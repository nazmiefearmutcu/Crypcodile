"""The Treasury par yield curve as a registered provider, so ``backfill`` can write it.

:class:`~crocodile.equity.providers.treasury.client.TreasuryYieldClient` had zero call sites
anywhere in ``src/``. Its module docstring argued — correctly, on the evidence it had — that
the source is not a websocket and that adding ``macro_series`` to a hand-written
``VALID_CHANNELS`` would offer the channel for ``alpaca``. Both objections are answered
elsewhere now (:class:`~crocodile.equity.providers.base.PullProvider` for the first,
:data:`~crocodile.equity.providers.factory.VALID_CHANNELS` for the second), and what the
argument missed is what an unreachable client costs: ``spot-future-basis``, ``funding-apr``
and ``perp-basis`` all subtract a risk-free leg read from the ``macro_series`` channel, and
in a lake no shipped path could write it, every one of those columns was null while the
provenance tail went on reporting a confidence of 0.667.

This is a backfill source and not a collect source, and that is a decision. Treasury
republishes the curve once per business day at about 3:30pm ET. A poll loop would re-read
the same CSV every interval for the twenty-three hours in which it has not changed, and
``collect``'s contract is an unbounded subscription — there is no bound at which it would
stop. ``backfill`` states a range, fetches the years the range touches, and finishes, which
is the shape of the question a curve answers.
