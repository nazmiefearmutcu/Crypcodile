"""SEC EDGAR as a registered provider: Form 4, 13F-HR, the filing index and XBRL facts.

:class:`~crocodile.equity.providers.sec_edgar.client.SecEdgarClient` could parse a Form 4
into an :class:`~crocodile.core.schema.records.InsiderTransaction` and a 13F-HR information
table into a :class:`~crocodile.core.schema.records.Holding13F` long before anything could
put either into the lake. ``whale-alerts`` for equities reads the ``insider`` channel, so it
answered zero rows on every lake this product could build — not because the parser was wrong
but because ``collect`` and ``backfill`` resolve against ``providers.factory._REGISTRY`` and
the client was not in it.

``holding_13f`` is the same absence one step further out. ``smart-money`` differences
consecutive information tables, but it takes them in ``params`` rather than reading them, so
nothing failed visibly while the channel had no writer — a caller simply had to obtain the
tables from somewhere that was not this product. That is why the end-to-end test for this
channel reads back through ``catalog-scan``: the round trip has to end somewhere, and where
it ends is a capability rather than a fixture.

**Backfill and not collect.** A filing is published when somebody files it, and EDGAR's
index is the record of that. There is no stream, and a poll loop would spend the ten
requests per second SEC allows re-reading an index that changes a few times a day per
issuer. ``backfill`` states a range and finishes, which is what a filing history is.

**The range is applied to the business date, not to** ``source_ts``. Neither
:func:`~…sec_edgar.form4.parse_form4` nor
:func:`~…sec_edgar.form13f.parse_13f_information_table` sets ``source_ts``, and both are
right not to: a Form 4 stamps calendar dates and never a time of day, so an instant there
would be a claim the document does not make. What the documents *do* state is on the
records — ``transaction_date`` on a Form 4 line and ``report_date`` on a 13F position — so
those are what a requested range filters. A row whose business date is unreadable is kept
rather than dropped, because dropping it would answer "this filing does not exist" to a
question about a range it may well fall inside.
