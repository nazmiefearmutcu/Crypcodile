"""The equity instrument universe, resolved from three registries that disagree.

``SPEC_METHODS`` M3 — "Equity universe from SEC EDGAR x OpenFIGI x Tiingo, merged by
CoverageResolver" — names three sources and a merge machine, and the merge machine already
existed: :class:`~crocodile.core.coverage.resolver.CoverageResolver` arrived with the equity
fork and its ``fill_nulls`` strategy is exactly "start from the highest-priority row and take
each missing field from the next one down". What did not exist was anything to hand it. The
comment scheduling ``collect-market`` states the gap precisely: ``Provider.list_instruments``
describes the symbols it was handed rather than discovering any, so no equity source in the
tree enumerated a universe at all. This module is the enumeration.

**Why these three, and what each one is for.** They are not redundant, which is why the merge
is a merge rather than a fallback chain:

SEC EDGAR ``company_tickers.json``
    The registrant index. It is the only source of a CIK and the only source of a
    registrant-attested company name — both of which it therefore wins in the merge, the
    second only since ``REFERENCE_PRIORITY`` was corrected to put it above OpenFIGI — and it
    is keyless: one static file, no token, no pagination. It knows nothing about *where* a
    security trades, because a filer is not a listing.
Tiingo ``supported_tickers.zip``
    The listing index. It is the only source that names an exchange for every row and the
    only one that publishes a price currency, and its file is also keyless — the endpoint's
    own docstring in ``providers/tiingo/client.py`` says it "does not require an API token or
    count towards quota". Tiingo is the source M3 might have been expected to need a key for,
    and this is the one endpoint of theirs that does not, which is what keeps the whole
    method keyless.
OpenFIGI ``/v3/mapping``
    The identifier registry: FIGI, composite and share-class FIGI, an exchange code and a
    security type, per ticker. It is the only *per-symbol* source of the three, and its
    keyless tier is twenty-five requests a minute in batches of ten — so it cannot be run
    across a ninety-thousand-row universe and is deliberately applied to the slice a caller
    asked for instead. See :meth:`ReferenceEvidence.with_figi`.

**What that costs, and where it is reported.** A row nobody enriched with FIGI is attested by
two sources rather than three, and the ``reference_merge`` confidence formula divides by a
fixed three precisely so that this reads as 0.67 rather than as a full house. That is the
product promise being kept rather than dodged: a keyless path that degrades and says so beats
a hard requirement for a key.

**Why a** :class:`Listing` **rather than a bare** :class:`~crocodile.core.schema.records.
Instrument`. Two facts the resolution produces have no field on the canonical record. The
price currency is one — only Tiingo publishes it, and no equity record in the tree carries a
currency, so widening the canonical union for it would be a lake-wide schema change to hold a
value one of three sources reports. The attestation set is the other, and it is not record
data at all: it is evidence *about* the record, which is what ``prov_confidence`` already
encodes as a ratio. Keeping both beside the instrument rather than inside it means the record
written into a ``channel=instrument/`` partition stays the record the union declares.

"""Who wins a field two sources both publish, highest first.

The order is an argument about what each source *is*, not about which is nicest. Exactly
three fields are contested — ``name``, ``exchange`` and ``security_type`` — and the order is
the answer to those three and nothing else; ``cik``, the FIGIs, ``currency`` and
``listing_date`` each have one publisher, so ``fill_nulls`` hands them over whatever the
order is.

Tiingo first because its rows are per **listing**. The question this universe answers is
"what trades, where", and a Tiingo row is one ticker on one exchange in one currency — the
grain of the answer. Its exchange name is also the human one (``NASDAQ``, ``NYSE``) rather
than a code, which is what makes ``markets`` readable, and its ``asset_type`` is a listing's
kind rather than an instrument's.

SEC second because it publishes exactly one contested field and is the right answer for it.
Its rows are per **registrant** — one filer covers every share class it issues — which is
why it has no exchange and no security type at all, and why the one thing it does report is
the registrant's *legal name*. That is what
:attr:`crocodile.core.schema.records.Instrument.name` is documented to hold, in
``providers/sec_edgar/client.py``: "the only registrant-attested company name in the tree".
It still wins every ``cik`` for the same reason it always did, because nothing else has one.

OpenFIGI last because its identifiers are **assigned** rather than inferred: a FIGI is
issued by a registrar and cannot be derived from anything else here, so where it speaks at
all it is authoritative — and it is uncontested there, so last place costs it nothing. On
the three contested fields it is the fallback and should be: its ``exch_code`` is a code
(``UW``, ``UN``) rather than a venue name, and its ``name`` is a security description
(``APPLE INC``) rather than a filer's legal name. It is also the only source not run over
the whole universe — its keyless tier is twenty-five requests a minute — so a source that
covers a slice cannot be the source that decides the shape of rows outside it.

**This order used to be** ``(TIINGO, OPENFIGI, SEC)``, **and the prose above it has always
described this one.** Three places said OpenFIGI's name loses to SEC's — here, this module's
header, and ``SecCompanyTicker``'s docstring — while ``fill_nulls`` is first-non-null-wins
and OpenFIGI outranked SEC, so SEC's ``title`` was unreachable on any row OpenFIGI had
matched. The test named ``test_sec_still_wins_the_name_over_openfigis_security_description``
asserted ``name == "APPLE INC"`` under a comment conceding the opposite, which is how it
survived: a test can certify the inverse of its own name and still be green.

What that cost is worth stating, because it is the reason the code moved rather than the
prose. ``Instrument.name`` carried two different quantities depending on which capability
produced the row: an unenriched row from ``census`` or ``collect-market`` had SEC's legal
name, and the same ticker out of ``universe`` — enriched, because a caller asked for a slice
— had OpenFIGI's uppercase description. One ticker, two conventions, decided by a code path
rather than by anything anyone chose. Moving SEC above OpenFIGI changes the resolution of
``name`` and of nothing else, since the other two contested fields are Tiingo's where Tiingo
speaks and OpenFIGI's where it does not, exactly as before. A ticker SEC does not register —
a foreign issuer, some ETF share classes — still takes OpenFIGI's description, so the
fallback is kept rather than discarded.

"""The volume evidence the ``top`` slice ranks on: mean traded volume per stored bar.

**The data source, named because a ranking without one is a league table nobody can check:
the lake's own ``channel=ohlcv/`` partitions.** Not a vendor screener and not a live quote —
the bars this deployment has already collected, whatever they are. That has a real cost,
stated here rather than discovered: a lake with no bars cannot rank anything, so the ``top``
slice refuses instead of answering, and the refusal names ``collect`` and ``backfill``.

**Why the mean rather than the sum.** The sum ranks by how long a symbol has been collected,
not by how much it trades: a ticker backfilled over two years outranks a more liquid one
picked up yesterday, and the ranking silently becomes a report on the collection schedule.
The mean divides that out and needs no window constant to do it — the alternative, "sum over
the last N days", would have to invent N, which is the move the provenance registry refuses
one layer down.

``WHERE volume > 0`` because a zero-volume bar is not evidence of low turnover. Quote-derived
bars carry a *structural* zero — ``ohlcv_from_quotes`` argues exactly that as the reason its
basis is SYNTHETIC — so counting them would drag a symbol's mean toward zero in proportion to
how many of its bars were built from quotes rather than trades.

``ORDER BY`` inside the statement rather than after it, so that a surface's ``row_limit``
truncates the *bottom* of the ranking. :meth:`CapabilityContext.query
