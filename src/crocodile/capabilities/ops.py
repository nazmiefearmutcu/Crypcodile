"""Capabilities that move data, plus the names no equity analogue can have.

Owns ``collect``, ``collect-market``, ``backfill``, ``replay``, ``export`` and
``resample``, and five of the seven entries of :data:`IRREDUCIBLE
<crocodile.core.capability.IRREDUCIBLE>` — ``gas-vol``, ``mev-sandwich``,
``sequencer-latency``, ``peg-deviation`` and ``lending-stress``. Those five are declared
here so the exemption list and the declarations it exempts can be read side by side; the
justification stays on ``IRREDUCIBLE``, where the gate looks for it. The other two,
``onchain-price`` and ``base-market-data``, are declared in
:mod:`crocodile.capabilities.onchain` — so every name on the list is a declared capability,
which is the state ``tests/capabilities/test_ops.py`` asserts and which it did not have
while ``gas-tracker`` sat there.

Two names this batch was asked to port are deliberately **not** declared, and each refusal
is argued where the declaration would have gone: ``gas-tracker`` (a Qt window, not a
capability — see :func:`_why_gas_tracker_is_not_a_capability`) and ``migrate-lake`` (a
directory rename, not a capability — see :func:`_why_migrate_lake_is_infrastructure`).
:data:`UNDECLARED` is the ledger of both, so a name declined on purpose cannot be mistaken
for one that was forgotten — which is the shape of the seven capabilities Phase 1 lost.

What ``ReturnKind.STREAM`` means, per surface
---------------------------------------------
``collect`` is the first capability in the product that never returns, so this is where
:attr:`ReturnKind.STREAM <crocodile.core.capability.ReturnKind.STREAM>` acquires a
meaning. The line that matters is not laziness — ``replay`` is lazy and is a ``TABLE`` —
it is **who owns the end of the sequence**:

``TABLE`` / ``SCALAR``
    finite, and the caller asked for all of it. Whether the implementation materialises it
    is an efficiency question the surface may answer either way.
``STREAM``
    unbounded, and the caller *subscribes*. There is no last element, so somebody other
    than the data has to decide when it stops.

A ``STREAM`` implementation therefore returns a :class:`Subscription` — a run that has not
started — and never awaits anything itself. That is not a stylistic choice. A capability
adapter cannot know whether it is being called from a synchronous CLI or from inside an
already-running event loop, and ``asyncio.run()`` raises ``RuntimeError`` in the second
case: an adapter that drove its own loop would work on the CLI and fail on REST and MCP,
which is precisely the shape this registry exists to end. The same rule makes ``backfill``
return its coroutine unstarted even though it is bounded.

The three surfaces then differ only in how long they hold the subscription:

CLI
    ``asyncio.run(sub.run())``. Unbounded is the native idiom here — the operator ends it
    with SIGINT — and ``duration_seconds`` bounds it when a run has to be unattended.
REST
    A request/response route cannot hold an unbounded subscription; the client would keep
    a socket open forever and every proxy between them would time it out first. The
    projection requires ``duration_seconds`` and answers when the bound expires. Because
    the capability hands back a run that has not started, the route can reject an
    unbounded request *before* a single socket is opened, rather than discovering it by
    hanging.
MCP
    Identical, and for a sharper reason: a tool call is one JSON-RPC request and one
    response, under a client-side timeout the server never sees. MCP's subscription
    primitive is a *resource*, not a tool, and this registry projects tools — so
    ``duration_seconds`` is required and must be smaller than the client's timeout.

Writers and surface trust
-------------------------
``collect``, ``collect-market`` and ``backfill`` write to the lake.
:attr:`CapabilityContext.readonly <crocodile.core.capability.CapabilityContext.readonly>`
is documented as how far a surface is trusted, and a surface that does not trust its
callers with mutating SQL cannot coherently trust them to start an unbounded write into
the operator's lake. :func:`_refuse_readonly` is that check, in one place, so the policy
cannot be forgotten per capability the way the SQL guard was forgotten per surface.

What does *not* belong here, or anywhere in this package: infrastructure. ``health``,
``ready``, ``version``, ``metrics``, ``docs``, ``/``, ``/api/events``, the x402 payment
routes, and the launchers ``mcp``, ``api``, ``update``, ``shell``, ``flowmap`` and
``gas-tracker`` are hand-written on the surfaces that have them. A capability is something
with an asset class, a parameter schema and a provenance; a readiness probe has none of
the three, and registering one would put it in the symmetry gate's subject list where it
can only ever be answered with an exemption.

    * It **returns nothing**. It opens a ``QMainWindow`` and blocks on a Qt event loop until
      the operator closes it, then calls ``sys.exit``.
    * It has **no provenance**. It renders whatever the gas oracle streams; it observes
      nothing itself, so there is no level ``prov`` could name and no method ``basis``
      could name.
    * It has **no asset class**, and could not acquire one. Its ``IRREDUCIBLE``
      justification — "L1/L2 gas markets have no equity analogue" — is an argument about
      *gas data*, which ``gas-vol`` already carries. What is undeclarable here is not the
      gas, it is the window.
    * It exists on exactly one surface and cannot reach the other two. There is no
      projection of "open a window on the operator's desktop" onto an HTTP route or a
      JSON-RPC tool.

    ``flowmap`` is the same thing — a Qt launcher over lake data — and it is *not* on
    ``IRREDUCIBLE``. That inconsistency is the evidence: the two were classified together
    as launchers by the survey, and only one of them picked up an exemption it never needed.

    The entry was left in place at first because ``core/capability.py`` was not this
    batch's to edit and because removing a name from ``IRREDUCIBLE`` is a claim of its own.

    **What the slice is, and why it is not one exchange's.** The crypto half resolves each
    source's own market list, because there a source *is* a venue and its universe is the
    thing it lists. An equity provider is not a venue: Alpaca and Finnhub serve the
    consolidated tape, so the market slice one of them can collect is the resolved universe
    rather than any single exchange's book. That is why ``sources`` here names providers while
    the universe comes from somewhere else entirely — from
    :mod:`crocodile.equity.reference.universe`, which is SPEC_METHOD M3's
    SEC EDGAR x OpenFIGI x Tiingo merge, and which is exactly the thing whose absence the
    comment below this capability's declaration used to describe.

    **The volume ranking, and its source, named.** ``top=N`` orders by mean traded volume per
    stored bar, read out of this lake's own ``channel=ohlcv/`` partitions — see
    :data:`~crocodile.equity.reference.universe.VOLUME_RANK_SQL`, which argues the statistic
    and the filter. There is no free whole-market equity volume board to rank against, so the
    honest source is the one this deployment already has, and a lake with no bars gets a
    refusal naming ``collect`` and ``backfill`` rather than an arbitrary N tickers wearing the
    word "top".

    **The ``all`` slice is volume-ordered too, which the crypto half's is not.** ``max_symbols``
    caps how much of a market is watched, and its own docstring is about a cap that silently
    answered a different question. Over a crypto venue's own market list the order at least
    comes from the venue; over a merged reference universe the natural order is alphabetical
    by ticker, so a cap of 500 would subscribe to five hundred tickers beginning with A and
    call it a market slice. Ordering by the same evidence first makes the cap take the part of
    the market anyone meant, and where the lake has no evidence at all it falls back to ticker
    order — which is the alphabetical slice, arrived at because there was nothing better and
    not by default.

    **No OpenFIGI.** This capability needs a symbol list and nothing else; a FIGI would buy an
    identifier no connector subscribes with. ``universe`` enriches because it returns rows a
    caller reads, and this returns a subscription.

    Everything judgeable without the network is judged before a :class:`Subscription` exists —
    including the SEC contact string, which is configuration and so must not first fail on an
    await inside somebody's event loop.

      rows is still a readable file that says what it would have held; equity writes a
      bare, column-less one.
    * **``limit`` push-down.** Crypto passes it into the scan; equity fetches everything
      and slices afterwards.

    Only one thing goes the other way — equity raised on a negative ``limit`` before

    capability, and the test is the registry's own vocabulary — asset class, parameter
    schema, provenance — none of which it can answer:

    * **No asset class.** It renames *both* legacy prefixes in a single pass over one lake.
      Declared with an impl per asset class, the two would be the same function doing the
      same whole-lake work and ignoring ``ctx.asset_class`` — and an impl keyed by a
      discriminator it cannot use is a capability that has no discriminator. That is not
      the ``indicators`` case, where one function serves both because OHLCV means the same
      thing in both markets; here there is one lake and one answer.
    * **No parameter schema.** Its only input is the lake root, which is
      ``ctx.settings.data_dir``. The struct would be empty.
    * **No provenance, and no honest way to fake one.** ``prov`` is "the best level this
      implementation can produce" and this one produces a count of renamed directories.
      ``NATIVE`` would claim a venue reported it; ``DERIVED`` would claim it was computed

      Parquet file is opened; ``SYNTHETIC`` would claim modelling; ``UNAVAILABLE`` is a
      typed hole. All four are false statements about a directory rename, and a provenance
      chosen because the field is required is the first decorative provenance in the tree.

    The line this draws against ``collect`` and ``backfill``, which also mutate the lake:
    those two **acquire records**, which have a venue, an asset class and a level. This one
    moves directories. A capability moves or computes records; ``migrate-lake`` moves paths.

    One real asymmetry falls out of the decision and is worth the coordinator's attention:
    the command exists on the crypto CLI only, so an equity-only operator has no way to
    migrate a ``provider=`` lake without installing the crypto surface. The fix is the
    hand-written command on the equity CLI, which is a surfaces change and not this
