"""Capabilities describing market structure and reference data.

Owns ``list-exchanges``, ``markets``, ``universe``, ``census``, ``open-interest`` and
``depth`` — what exists to trade, where, and in what size, as opposed to what the lake
happens to hold about it.

Four of the six reach a venue rather than the lake, which makes this the batch where the
two questions below had to be answered once, out loud, instead of per declaration.

**Why every adapter here is synchronous, including the four whose work is not.**
``exchange_instruments``, ``top_symbols_by_volume``, ``market_census`` and
``DepthSource.snapshot`` are all ``async def``, while
:data:`~crocodile.core.capability.CapabilityFn` is one calling convention for three
surfaces — and the CLI projection is synchronous where the REST and MCP ones run on an
event loop. An ``async`` ``Impl.fn``
would therefore force every surface to branch on ``inspect.iscoroutinefunction`` — the
signature introspection that convention exists to refuse — and a surface that forgot would
not crash: it would hand the caller a coroutine object that never runs, which is a wrong
answer wearing a passing call. A capability that works on MCP and hangs on the CLI is worse
than one that is not declared, so the coroutine is driven to completion inside the adapter,
by :func:`~crocodile.core.capability.run_to_completion`, and what every surface gets back is
a value. That helper started here and moved to the machinery when a second batch wrote its
own bare ``asyncio.run`` and broke two surfaces out of three with it.

**Why none of them needs a live client on the context.**
:class:`~crocodile.core.capability.CapabilityContext` carries a ``Catalog`` and a
``Settings`` and no client, and nothing here wants one: ``universe`` and ``census``
construct their own ``ccxt``/``aiohttp`` sessions inside the coroutine and close them
again, and ``depth``'s equity half asks
:func:`~crocodile.equity.depth.select.select_depth_source` for a source rather than being
handed one. ``open-interest`` reads the lake through ``ctx.catalog``, exactly as
``slippage`` does, and ``depth``'s crypto half reads it through ``ctx.query``, which is
where a surface's ``readonly`` and ``row_limit`` are applied. The one thing that *is* read
from outside the context is the pair of Alpaca keys, and that read happens inside
``select_depth_source``; see :func:`depth`.

The equity halves of this family are where :data:`SPEC_METHODS
<crocodile.core.capability.SPEC_METHODS>` M2 and M3 landed, and the block at the foot of this
module is the record of what left and why. Every entry is gone: ``open-interest`` off M2,
``markets``, ``universe`` and ``census`` off M3 — all three answering out of
:mod:`crocodile.equity.reference.universe` — and ``depth`` off M8, which is the one the
ledger could not express because its missing half was the crypto one. ``list-exchanges``
never needed an entry; both markets could always answer it.

A fifth question this batch had to answer, once M3 gave it two adapters per capability rather
than one: **an asymmetric capability resolves its own asset class and a symmetric one does
not.** ``crocodile.surfaces.dispatch.resolve_asset_class`` falls through to "there is only one
implementation, so there is nothing to decide" — and four capabilities here just stopped
having one. None of ``MarketsParams``, ``UniverseParams``, ``CensusParams`` or
``OpenInterestParams`` carries a ``symbol`` field, so nothing about a request for them is
evidence about a market, and callers name ``--asset-class`` explicitly from here on. That is
the documented step 3 of that function's order working as designed rather than a regression:
the alternative is defaulting to crypto, which would answer an equity request with a crypto
venue list and no error.

    and the elements are OR-ed, so a list of symbols was never a list of symbol identities —
    it was a list of patterns, and a lone string was the one-element case.

    Both plural spellings were therefore broken in opposite directions. REST handed its

    made the list arm unreachable from the wire, so the only callers who could use it were

# a build fact, because no equity venue ships a connector here and the only thing that knows
# NASDAQ exists is the reference data. So the equity half reaches the network where the
# crypto half does not, and the two are symmetric in what they answer rather than in what
# they cost.

# `markets`, `universe` and `census` were here against M3 and have left, which is the ledger
# working rather than the ledger shrinking: all three fell out of one piece of reference data,
# so they were scheduled together and they closed together. What closed them is
# `crocodile.equity.reference.universe` — SEC EDGAR x OpenFIGI x Tiingo merged by
# `CoverageResolver`, which is M3 word for word. The matching lines in
# `tests/conformance/test_pending_symmetry.py::_LEDGER_AS_SHIPPED` went in the same commit,
# because a gate there asserts the two agree and a schedule only means something while
# somebody has to look at both halves of a departure.

    {
        # This block is empty, and every paragraph in it is written in the past tense on
        # purpose: it is the record of what the ledger held and how each entry left, kept
        # because the arguments outlived the entries. Anything still scheduled would appear
        # as a live mapping below, not as a sentence.
        #
        # An equity venue list and an equity instrument universe both fell out of the same
        # reference data, so both waited on the same method — see M3 at the end of this
        # block, which is what closed them and the census with them.
        # `open-interest` was here against M2 and is repaid: the equity half sums the
        # stored Yahoo chain's per-contract `openInterest` per underlying, which is what
        # M2 specified, and both halves now widen their samples through the one function
        # in `core.analytics.open_interest` so the two boards are the same table.
        # `depth` was here too, mapped to M6, and it is the entry this block should be read
        # backwards from. It was the one whose *direction* the ledger could not express:
        # every method in SPEC_METHODS closes an equity gap, and depth's missing half was
        # the crypto one, because the equity half — the synthetic VAP ladder upgraded by
        # Alpaca L1, which this module declares — is what already shipped. M6 describes
        # that equity half, so M6 was already spent and could never have closed this. The
        # entry was scheduled against it anyway, because IRREDUCIBLE would have claimed a
        # crypto order book cannot exist and leaving the capability undeclared is the
        # silent absence the registry exists to end. It was recorded as honest about being
        # asymmetric and wrong about which direction, on the argument that Phase 3's exit
        # gate would force somebody to look at it. It did.
        #
        # M8 is what looking at it produced, and closing the entry meant deleting it rather
        # than remapping it to M8: the ledger's own gate refuses a re-map, on the ground
        # that a method is the plan that closes a gap and swapping one is a re-plan rather
        # than a correction. A capability with both halves needs no schedule at all, so the
        # clean resolution is the entry's absence, here and in `_LEDGER_AS_SHIPPED`.
        #
        # What it actually took was the missing confidence formula, which is the part the
        # old note named and could not supply: `book_snapshot_slice` in
        # `core/schema/provenance.py`, measuring how much of the requested ladder the store
        # held and how much of the caller's staleness tolerance the answer used up. `native`
        # would have claimed the venue published this ladder and `book_resample` measures a
        # boundary lookahead a slice has none of — both true when it was written, and
        # neither an argument for inventing a number.
        #
        # M3 closed the last three — `markets`, `universe` and `census` — and with them
        # this module's ledger. All three answer out of
        # `crocodile.equity.reference.universe`, which merges SEC EDGAR, Tiingo and
        # OpenFIGI through `CoverageResolver`, because no equity venue ships a connector
        # here and the only thing that knows NASDAQ exists is the reference data. So the
        # equity halves reach the network where the crypto halves read the build, and the
        # two are symmetric in what they answer rather than in what they cost.
        #
        # The update below therefore adds nothing. It is kept, with its notes, because
        # this block is the record of what this batch owed and how each debt was paid;
        # deleting it would leave the ledger's own gates asserting over a silence.
