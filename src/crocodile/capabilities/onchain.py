"""The two Base-mainnet pool readers, declared because the deletion had nowhere to put them.

This module is not one of the four batches the porting agents filled. It exists because the
surface-parity gate caught something at the end of Phase 2 that the port had missed: three
wire names — the MCP tools ``get_onchain_price`` and ``get_base_market_data`` on *both*
forks, and the equity route ``GET /api/v1/market-data`` — were on the wire before the
deletion and were served by nothing in :data:`~crocodile.core.capability.REGISTRY` after it.

There were three ways out and two of them were false:

- **Call them infrastructure.** ``_INFRASTRUCTURE`` in the parity gate means *never a
  capability*, and it is not true here. These take a parameter, return a measurement of a
  market, and have a provenance: a Uniswap V3 pool's ``slot0`` and an Aerodrome pool's
  ``getReserves`` are the venue reporting its own state, which is exactly what
  :attr:`Provenance.NATIVE` names. Writing "not a capability" on that would be the kind of
  exemption this project's gates exist to refuse.
- **Delete the fixture entry.** The one thing that defeats the gate.
- **Serve them.** This.

They are crypto-only and permanently so, so both are on
:data:`~crocodile.core.capability.IRREDUCIBLE` rather than
:data:`~crocodile.core.capability.PENDING_SYMMETRY`: an automated market maker is a
chain-native price venue, and there is no equity instrument whose price is a function of two
pooled reserves. That is a claim about the market, which is the bar ``IRREDUCIBLE`` sets.

Why two capabilities and not one with a flag: they were two tools, they take differently
spelled inputs, and ``base-market-data`` costs an 1 800-block log scan that ``onchain-price``
does not. Folding them would be a redesign, and what this module is doing is restoring.

The implementations are :func:`crocodile.crypto.exchanges.base_onchain.price.get_onchain_price`
and :func:`~crocodile.crypto.exchanges.base_onchain.price.get_base_market_data`, moved out of
the deleted MCP server into the connector package they read through, unchanged.
